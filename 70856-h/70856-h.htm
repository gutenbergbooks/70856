<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/deco.jpg" alt=""></div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I have</span> surveyed most of the learning found among
the sons of men,” said the learned Seldon, “but I
can stay my soul upon none of them but the
Bible;” and precisely similar has been the experience
of many others.</p>

<p>The Bible is in the Scripture declared to be
that which the Holy Spirit employs both in conversion
and in sanctification; it is therefore needful
above all things that we should know our Bibles
well. Nothing can compensate for the want of
this, and at the same time a spiritual knowledge
of the Scriptures will often atone for natural deficiencies,
both in mental equipment and in social
position.</p>

<p>The man, therefore, who brings the Bible to
bear efficiently upon the hearts and lives of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
fellow-creatures is the true servant of God; what
then shall be said in praise of William Tyndale?</p>

<p>Before his day such copies of Wycliffe’s Version
as still survived could only be consulted in secret;
they were but few in number, and the language
in which they were written had become obsolete.
Tyndale conceived the bold idea of translating the
Scriptures so that the poorest might be able to
obtain and to understand them.</p>

<p>For this noble object he lived and died, and
Englishmen should never forget that the priceless
boon of an open Bible, which is the secret source
of our national liberties and success, was paid for
by Tyndale with his blood.</p>

<p>Tyndale does not regret the purchase now, for
although duty exacts a heavy fine, it more than
repays those who give up all things that they
may possess her.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I have</span> long adopted an expedient which I have
found of singular service to me,” said Richard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
Cecil. “I have a shelf in my study for tried
authors, and one in my mind for tried principles
and characters.</p>

<p>“When an author has stood a thorough examination
and will bear to be taken as a guide, <span class="smcap">I put him
on the shelf!</span></p>

<p>“When I have most fully made up my mind on a
principle, <span class="smcap">I put it on the shelf!</span></p>

<p>“When I have turned a character over and over
on all sides, and seen it through and through in all
situations, <span class="smcap">I put it on the shelf!</span>”</p>

<p>William Tyndale is a man whose character may
be placed upon the shelf, for he and his life have
successfully endured the test of the ages that have
in turn examined him, and sometimes not with the
kindest of feelings. It is difficult for us to estimate
adequately the magnitude of his success, because
the whole current of religious life has changed since
his time, and mainly because of what he accomplished.
A great writer has imagined what would
occur if some morning every sentence of the Scriptures
were obliterated both from the printed page
and from the minds of men; he believes that <i>a blank
Bible would mean a blank world</i>, and that was largely
the moral condition of things into which Tyndale was
born. There was no Bible, at least in circulation,
and therefore there were ignorance, tyranny, hopelessness,
and discord. The Reformation was not only
a bringing-in of a new life beyond the grave, it also
gave fresh hope and meaning to the existence on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
this side of death; so that commercial enterprise
and national liberty are products of that period.</p>

<p>Frith, in his amusing autobiography, tells us of
a picture-dealer who said of Dickens and his
writings, “He couldn’t help writing ’em. He deserves
no credit for that. He a clever man! Let
him go and sell a lot of pictures to a man that
don’t want ’em, as I have done lots of times; that’s
what I call being a clever man!”</p>

<p>The same has practically been long felt if not
expressed about William Tyndale, for it is only of
late years that his supreme ability has been admitted.
Yet he was undoubtedly a great man;
Foxe calls him “the true servant and martyr of
God, who, for his notable pains and travail, may
well be called the Apostle of England.” Tyndale
is rightly so called, for he, in spite of the Bishops,
gave to the world a book which they did not desire,
and in so doing he did more for the English Reformation
than the King and Parliament combined.</p>

<p>Of the early days of this great man but very little
is known. Foxe, in his Life of William Tyndale,
says that he “was born about the borders of Wales,
and brought up from a child in the University of
Oxford, where he, by long continuance, grew up
and increased as well in the knowledge of tongues
and other liberal arts, as especially in the knowledge
of the Scriptures, <i>whereunto his mind was
singularly addicted</i>, insomuch that he, lying then in
Magdalen Hall, read privily to certain students and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
fellows of Magdalen College some parcel of divinity;
instructing them in the knowledge and truth of the
Scriptures. His manners also and conversation,
being correspondent to the same, were such that all
they that knew him reputed and esteemed him to
be a man of most virtuous disposition and of life
unspotted. Thus he, in the University of Oxford,
increasing more and more in learning and proceeding
in degrees of the schools, spying his time, removed
from thence to the University of Cambridge,
where, after he had likewise made his abode a certain
space, being now further ripened in the knowledge
of God’s Word, leaving that University also,
he resorted to one Master Welch, a knight of Gloucestershire.”
In these few lines Foxe concentrates
the history of several years, and these were years of
supreme interest and importance both to the man
and to us. Nor has subsequent research done very
much to fill in this gap, although one or two things
are now clear to us.</p>

<p>It was for a long time believed that William
Tyndale was a son of Thomas Tyndale of Hunts
Court, the manor-house of North Nibley, a village in
Gloucestershire. Accordingly a monument has been
erected upon Nibley Knoll (one of the Cotswold
Hills) in his honour—a noble column which is still
conspicuous from far in that pleasant country. But
it has been shown that this could not have been,
and that not to the manor-house, but to a farmhouse,
must we look for the birthplace of our hero. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
Melksham Court, in the parish of Stinchcombe, there
had long lived a family of Tyndales, who, it is said,
had originally come from the North of England. This
was during the Wars of the Roses, and in order to
elude the proscription which in turn visited the
adherents of each house, these Tyndales assumed
the name of Hutchins.</p>

<p>It is probable that these farmers, whose lands
were principally swamps that had been reclaimed
from the Severn, were the ancestors of William
Tyndale. The Tyndales of North Nibley were,
however, probably relatives of these farmers. The
precise date of William Tyndale’s birth cannot be
stated, but from the fact that, in his reply to Sir
Thomas More, Tyndale said, “These things to be
even so M. More knoweth well enough, for he
understandeth the Greek, and he knew them long
ere I did,” it is inferred that More was at least
some years the elder. More was born in the year
1478 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, and therefore it is conjectured that
about 1480 was the date of Tyndale’s birth. Of
Slymbridge, his probable birthplace, Demaus says
that it “was then, as now, wholly engrossed in the
production of cheese and butter; a quiet agricultural
parish, where life would flow on calmly as
the great river that formed its boundary. The
dairymaid was the true annalist of Slymbridge;
and the only occurrence beyond drought which
would distress the peaceful population would be
occasional predatory incursions of their lawless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
neighbours from the Forest of Dean, which waved
in hills of verdure towards the west, as a picturesque
counterbalance to the Cotswolds in the
east. Such a place one naturally associates with
stagnant thought and immemorial tradition.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>One would have been thankful for an account of
the home life of the Tyndales, and especially for some
information about the two parents. We can imagine
the grave, sober farmer given up to religious observances
like his neighbours, thinking grimly
but silently of the evils which he saw in the
Churches around him; perhaps also with a tinge
of Lollardism as carefully concealed as might be.
And the sober, diligent mother, not wholly occupied
with the pursuits of the farm, but thinking high
thoughts about God and life, that from time to
time she communicated to her sons. From what
we know of their children, we must form a high
estimate of the parents.</p>

<p>Four sons, it would seem, formed the family group,
and they were named respectively Richard Tyndale
(who succeeded to the farm), Edward Tyndale, William
the Martyr, and John Tyndale, a merchant in
London.</p>

<p>It is a fact that the last named was fined for
sending money to his brother William when the
latter was abroad, and for aiding him in the circulation
of the Scriptures, so that in all probability
the brothers were of one mind in religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
opinions. One brother, Edward Tyndale, was appointed
receiver of the revenues of Berkley, which
had been left to the Crown in the year 1492, so
that he at anyrate was fairly well-to-do.</p>

<p>Tyndale himself, in his “Obedience of a Christian
Man,” to which reference will be further made later
on in this biography, makes the following allusion
to his own childhood:—“Except my memory fail
me, and that I have forgotten what I read when I
was a child, thou shalt find in the English Chronicle,
how that King Adelstone (Athelstone) caused the
Holy Scripture to be translated into the tongue that
then was in England, and how prelates exhorted him
thereto.”</p>

<p>We may therefore suppose that the child was
taught at home in the ancient records of the Kingdom,
and perhaps his attention was called by his
father to the significant fact that then the Scriptures
could not be read by the people, whereas this had
been permitted in earlier days. It is singular that
the boy should have noticed such a fact, and it
suggests that some one significantly indicated it to
him. It is certain that a strong sympathy for the
opinions of Wycliffe and his followers existed all
through the West of England, and probably William
Tyndale’s father hinted to his sons what he did not
dare to speak out to others. And there were also
here and there, men, in monasteries, vicarages, and
dwelling-houses, who were beginning to discern the
coming dawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>“Midnight being past,” says Fuller, “some early
risers were beginning to strike fire and enlighten
themselves from the Scriptures.” And there was
indeed great need for them to do so, for the religious
condition of England was at that time lamentable.</p>

<p>As an example of the dissoluteness of the national
manners, and principally amongst the clergy, it is said
of Mr. Edmund Loud, a gentleman of rank in Huntingdonshire,
that he “was disgusted at the dissolute
lives of the monks of Sawtry, an abbey in his neighbourhood,
and even ventured to chastise one of them
who had insulted his daughter. For this, and other
circumstances, they determined to be revenged; and
he was waylaid and assaulted by six men, tenants
of the abbey. He defended himself with a billhook
for some time, till a constable came up and
stopped the fray, and Mr. Loud was required to give
up his weapon. They then proceeded peaceably
with the constable; but, watching an opportunity,
as Mr. Loud was crossing a stile, one seized him by
the arms, while another fractured his skull with the
blow of a club, and he died seven days afterwards.
The murderers escaped, and the influence of the
Romish clergy prevented the matter being properly
followed up.”</p>

<p>Dr. Henry in his history of this period observes,
however, that “there was one vice, indeed, which
the clergy most zealously endeavoured to extirpate.
This was what they called the damnable vice of
heresy, which consisted in reading the New Testament<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
in English, the works of Wickliff and Luther,
and of others of that learning; in denying the infallibility
of the Pope, transubstantiation, purgatory,
praying to saints, worshipping images, &amp;c. Notwithstanding
the cruel punishments that had been
inflicted on those who entertained these opinions,
their number was still considerable, particularly in
London, and in Colchester, and in other parts of Essex.
They called themselves Brethren in Christ, and met
together with great secrecy in one another’s houses,
to read the New Testament and other books, and to
converse upon religious subjects. Many of them
were apprehended, and brought before Cuthbert
Tonstall, bishop of London, and Dr. Wharton, his
chancellor. But Bishop Tonstall, being a prelate
of uncommon learning and eloquence, and of great
humanity, earnestly tried to prevail upon them to
renounce, or rather to dissemble, their opinions, by
which they escaped a painful death, but incurred
the painful reproaches of their minds.”</p>

<p>As a specimen of those who were brought before
the tribunals, take these cases:—</p>

<p>“Elizabeth Wightil deposed against her mistress,
Alice Doly, that speaking of John Hacher, a water-bearer
in Coleman Street, London, she said he was so
very expert in the Gospels and the Lord’s Prayer in
English, that it did her good to hear him. She was
also said to have heretical books in her possession.</p>

<p>“Roger Hackman, of Oxfordshire, was accused for
saying in the county of Norfolk, ‘I will never look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
to be saved for any good deed that ever I did,
neither for any that I shall ever do, unless I have
my salvation by petition, as an outlaw pardoned by
the king;’ adding, ‘that if he might not have his
salvation so, he thought he should be lost.’” If such
doctrine as this was condemned, we cannot wonder
at hearing of “certain heretical books called the
Epistles and Gospels.”</p>

<p>The darkness was indeed thick, but happily the
dawning was at hand.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> an early age William Tyndale was sent to
Oxford, where he was entered at Magdalen Hall.
Here we can perhaps picture him from the words
of Thomas Lever, who in a sermon which was
preached later describes the University life of his
day. With some modifications, it may perhaps
stand for Tyndale’s experience:—</p>

<p>“There are divers there which rise daily between
four and five o’clock in the morning, and from five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
until six o’clock use common prayer, with an exhortation
of God, and in a common chapel. From
six until ten o’clock they use either private study
or common lectures. At ten of the clock they go
to dinner, whereat they be content with a greasy
piece of beef amongst four, having a few pottage
made of the broth of the same beef, with salt and
oatmeal, and nothing else. After this slender dinner,
they be either teaching or learning until five of
the clock in the evening, when they have a supper
not much better than their dinner. Immediately
after which they go either to reasoning in problems
or unto some other study, until it be nine or ten of
the clock, and then, being without fire, are fain to
walk or run up and down half an hour, to get a
heat in their feet, when they go to bed.”</p>

<p>With some few modifications, this description
may stand for the student life of Tyndale, and
it is certainly a picture of hard living and of
stern training. In the year 1512 William Tyndale
received his degree of B.A., and in 1515 he was
licensed M.A. For some reason which cannot very
clearly be discovered, Tyndale afterwards left Oxford
for Cambridge, where Erasmus was at that time lecturing.</p>

<p>It has been pointed out by Demaus, in his admirable
and exhaustive biography, that Tyndale’s famous
sentence was merely a re-echo of what Erasmus had
said long before. In the exhortation prefixed to one
of his works Erasmus wrote: “I totally dissent from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
those who are unwilling that the Sacred Scriptures,
translated into the vulgar tongue, should be read
by private individuals, as if Christ had taught
such subtle doctrines that they can with difficulty
be understood by a very few theologians, or
as if the strength of the Christian religion lay in
men’s ignorance of it. The mysteries of kings it
were perhaps better to conceal, but Christ wishes His
mysteries to be published as widely as possible. I
would wish even all women to read the Gospels and
the Epistles of St. Paul. And I wish they were
translated into <i>all languages of all people, that they
might be read and known, not merely by the Scotch
and the Irish, but even by the Turks and the Saracens.
I wish that the husbandman may sing parts of them
at his plough, that the weaver may warble them at
his shuttle, that the traveller may with their narratives
beguile the weariness of the way.</i>”</p>

<p>These are indeed noble words, and one wishes
that Erasmus had possessed the courage of his
convictions, but his selfishness, weakness, and love
of ease prevented him from braving the risks that
Luther and Tyndale incurred. He was like the
courtier who advised Latimer to remain a papist
until “it pleased God to add to Latimer’s opinions
converts in such honest number” as to make profession
of his belief safe and respectable. Tyndale
was of other and of harder material than Erasmus,
and therefore he obtained the success that he did.
Withes may be useful for making baskets, but heart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
of oak and iron are required for the construction of
warships. “In almost all plans of great enterprise,”
says John Foster, “a man must systematically dismiss
at the entrance every wish to stipulate with
his destiny for his safety. He voluntarily treads
within the precincts of danger; and though it be
possible he may escape, <i>he ought to be prepared</i> with
the fortitude of <i>a self-devoted victim</i>. This is the
inevitable condition on which ... Reformers must
commence their career. Either they must allay
their fire of enterprise, or abide the liability to be
exploded by it from the world.” Such was William
Tyndale; while the character of Erasmus is sketched
in the words in which the same writer describes the
man without decision of character: “He belongs to
whatever can make capture of him. One thing
after another vindicates its right to him while he is
trying to go on, as twigs and chips floating near
the edge of a river are intercepted by every weed
and whirled in every little eddy.”</p>

<p>At Cambridge, therefore, Tyndale remained, and
there he not only began “to smell the Word of God,”
but he also made choice of his future profession.
During his course at the Universities, Tyndale had
at least one pupil to whom he made reference
in his last letter to Fryth the martyr. In the
year 1521 Tyndale left Cambridge and went to
live as chaplain and tutor at the house of Sir
John Walsh in Little Sodbury, Gloucestershire.
The mansion of this local magnate “is charmingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
situated on the south-western slope of the Cotswolds,
and enjoys a magnificent prospect over the richly
wooded vale of the Severn, to the distant hills of
Wales. Though somewhat shorn of its former
dignity, and only in part inhabited, the house is still,
in the main, intact; time indeed has dealt gently
with it, and has added to the beauties of its graceful
and varied architecture those mellowing touches
which delight the eye of the lover of the picturesque.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Here Tyndale lived for years, and in this quiet
seclusion he had sufficient leisure to reflect upon
the matters which had previously engaged his attention;
it was here that he fully resolved to devote
himself to the great enterprise with which his
name is inseparably associated. For the intellectual
revival that had set in all through Europe
had reached England also; and men no longer cared
to waste their time in discussing such puerilities
as Erasmus states that in the solemn disputations
of the scholars were discussed. As, for example,
such questions as—“Whether the Pope can command
angels?” “Whether he be a mere man, or,
as God, participates in both natures with Christ?”
“And whether he be not more merciful than Christ
was, since we do not read that Christ ever recalled
any from the pains of purgatory?”</p>

<p>Old Foxe who obtained his information from an
eye-witness, who is believed by Demaus to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
been Richard Webb, who was afterwards servant to
Latimer, speaks thus of Tyndale’s life in the old
manor-house: “Master Tyndale being in service
with one Master Walsh, a knight, who married a
daughter of Sir Robert Poyntz, a knight dwelling in
Gloucestershire. The said Tyndale being school-master
to the said Master Walsh’s children, and
being in good favour with his master, sat most
commonly at his own table. Which Master Walsh
kept a good ordinary commonly at his table, and there
resorted unto him many times sundry abbots, deans,
archdeacons, with divers other doctors, and great
beneficed men; who there, together with Master
Tyndale sitting at the same table, did use many
times to enter communication, and talk of learned
men, as of Luther and of Erasmus; also of divers
other controversies and questions upon the Scripture.
Then Master Tyndale, as he was learned and well
practised in God’s matters, so he spared not to show
unto them simply and plainly his judgment in
matters, as he thought; and when they at any time
did vary from Tyndale in opinions and judgment, he
would show them in the book, and lay plainly before
them the open and manifest places of the Scriptures,
to confute their errors and confirm his sayings.
And thus continued they for a certain season, reasoning
and contending together divers and sundry
times, till at length they waxed weary, and bare a
secret grudge in their hearts against him.</p>

<p>“So upon a time,” continues Foxe, “some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
these beneficed doctors bid Master Walsh and the
lady his wife at a supper or banquet, there having
among them talk at will without any gainsaying.
The supper or banquet being done, and Master
Walsh and his lady being come home, they called
for Master Tyndale, and talked with him of such
communication as had been where they came from
and of their opinions. Master Tyndale thereunto
made answer agreeable to the truth of God’s Word,
and in reproving of their false opinions. The
Lady Walsh, being a stout woman, and as Master
Tyndale did report her to be wise, there being no
more but they three, Master Walsh, his wife, and
Master Tyndale: ‘Well,’ said she, ‘there was such
a doctor he may dispend two hundred pound by the
year; another one hundred pound; and another
three hundred pound; and what think ye, <i>were it
reason that we should believe you before them so great,
learned, and beneficed men</i>?’ Master Tyndale,
hearing her, gave her no answer; nor after that
had but small arguments against such, for he
perceived it would not help, in effect to the
contrary.”</p>

<p>The character of the disputes may be inferred
from the following paragraph which has been compiled
by D’Aubigné from Tyndale’s writings:—</p>

<p>“In the dining-room of the old hall a varied
group was assembled round the hospitable table.
There were Sir John and Lady Walsh, a few
gentlemen of the neighbourhood, with several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
abbots, deans, monks, and doctors in their respective
costumes. Tyndale occupied the humblest
place, and generally kept Erasmus’ New Testament
within reach, in order to prove what he advanced.
Numerous domestics were moving about engaged in
waiting on the guests; and at length the conversation,
after wandering a little, took a more precise
direction. The priests grew impatient when they
saw the terrible volume appear. ‘Your Scriptures
only seem to make heretics,’ they exclaimed. ‘On
the contrary,’ replied Tyndale, ‘the source of
heresies is pride; now, the Word of God strips
man of everything, and leaves him as bare as Job.’
‘The Word of God! Why, even we don’t understand
your Word; how can the vulgar understand
it?’ ‘You don’t understand it,’ rejoined Tyndale,
‘because you look into it only for foolish questions.
Now, the Scriptures are a clue, which we must
follow without turning aside until we arrive at
Christ, for Christ is the end.’ ‘And I tell you,’
shouted out another priest, ‘that the Scriptures are
a Dædalian labyrinth—a conjuring-book wherein
everybody finds what he wants.’ ‘Alas!’ replied
Tyndale, ‘you read them without Jesus Christ;
that’s why they are an obscure book to you. What
do I say? A grave of briars; if thou loose thyself
in one place thou art caught in another.’ ‘No; it
is we who give the Scriptures, and we who explain
them to you.’ ‘You set candles before images,’
replied Tyndale; ‘and since you give them light,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
why don’t you give them food? Why don’t you
make their bellies hollow, and put victuals and drink
inside? To serve God by such mummeries is treating
Him like a spoilt child, whom you pacify with
a toy, or you make him a horse out of a stick.’”</p>

<p>It is no wonder that such discussions (for this
picture is probably a fair sample of many, that took
place both in the hall of the manor-house, and in
the houses of the neighbouring clergy and gentry)
disturbed the minds of the knight and of his wife.
As Tyndale could not reply to the argument from
wealth, he called in the aid of Erasmus, who was then
at the zenith of his fame. Some eleven years before,
Erasmus had written a book entitled “The Manual
of a Christian Soldier.” This work Tyndale translated
and placed in the hands of Lady Walsh.
The opinions of Tyndale were, of course, despicable
because he was poor, but Erasmus was the pet of
princes, and his words could not well be disregarded.
Erasmus in this book had condemned the follies of
the Church teachers of his day, and demanded,
concerning those things which pertain to faith,
“Why, let them be expressed in the fewest possible
articles; those which pertain to good living, let
them also be expressed in few words, and so expressed
that men may understand that the yoke of
Christ is easy and light, and not harsh; that they
may see that in the clergy they have found fathers
and not tyrants; pastors, not robbers; that they
are invited to salvation, and not dragged to slavery.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“After they had read this book,” says Foxe,
“these great prelates were no more so often called
to the house, nor when they came had the cheer
and countenance as they were wont to have,
the which they did well perceive, and also that it
was by the means and incensing of Master Tyndale,
and at last they came no more there.”</p>

<p>Tyndale had converted the knight and his wife,
but he had also made for himself some implacable
and restless enemies. He further increased their
hatred by preaching in the villages round about,
and, as one tradition asserts, even in Bristol. The
priests inflamed one another with hatred against
him, and at length Tyndale was summoned before
the Chancellor of the diocese to answer for his
conduct.</p>

<p>“When I came before the Chancellor, he threatened
me grievously, and reviled me, and rated me
as though I had been a dog; and laid to my charge
whereof there could be none accused brought forth,”
says Tyndale himself of this trial.</p>

<p>But Tyndale was not the man to desist when once
he had learned what his duty was. He has chronicled
the workings of his mind at this period thus: “A
thousand books had they lever (rather) to be put forth
against their abominable doings and doctrines than
that the Scripture should come to light ... which
thing only moved me to translate the New Testament.
Because <i>I had perceived by experience</i> how it
was impossible to establish the lay-people in any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
truth, except the Scriptures were plainly laid before
their eyes in their mother-tongue, that they might
see the process, order, and meaning of the text: for
else, whatsoever truth is taught them these enemies
of all truth quench it again.”</p>

<p>In his perplexity Tyndale sought for counsel and
sympathy from “a certain doctor that dwelt not far
off, and had been an old Chancellor before to a
bishop. ‘Do you not know,’ said the ex-Chancellor,
‘that the Pope is very antichrist, whom the Scripture
speaketh of? But beware what you say; for
if you shall be perceived to be of that opinion, it
will cost you your life. I have been an officer of
his, but I have given it up, and I defy him and all
his works.’”</p>

<p>Soon after this visit “Master Tyndale happened
to be in the company of a learned man, and in
communing and disputing with him, drove him to
that issue that the learned man said, ‘We had
better be without God’s laws than the Pope’s.’
Master Tyndale hearing that, answered him, ‘I
defy the Pope and all his laws;’ and said, ‘<span class="smcap">If God
spare my life, ere many years I will cause a
boy that driveth the plough shall know more
of the Scripture than thou doest.</span>’”</p>

<p>These noble words were, of course, soon published
through the district, and they intensified the hatred
of the priests still more against him. Tyndale was
quite willing to leave the neighbourhood, and he even
offered to settle in any English county if they would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
but permit him to teach the children and to preach
there. But seeing the peril to which he had exposed
his friends, and perhaps still more acutely
realising that his work could not be accomplished
in Sodbury, Tyndale took leave of his patron, and
came up to London.</p>

<p>NO ROOM FOR A BIBLE IN THE BISHOP’S PALACE—THE MERCHANT’S

</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tyndale</span> came to London (probably about 1523)
provided with a letter of introduction to Sir Harry
Guildford, the Controller of the Royal Household,
and a great favourite with the King. This, Tyndale
trusted, would also secure for him a favourable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
reception from Tunstal, the Bishop of London, who was
a friend of Erasmus and a patron of the new learning.</p>

<p>At the time of Tyndale’s arrival in the metropolis,
London was deeply agitated about Wolsey’s
tyranny; for the Cardinal had demanded from Parliament
a subsidy that amounted to a tax of four
shillings in the pound upon all property in England.
When this was refused, as an utter impossibility,
Wolsey dismissed the Parliament. This summary
proceeding excited great indignation against the
Cardinal, whose extravagance, pride, and tyranny
were in every mouth. Moreover, the books of
Luther were secretly in circulation among the
people, and probably Tyndale saw at least some of
them. He was himself unconscious of the steps
by which he was being led to where alone he could
effectually accomplish his life-work of translating
the Scriptures. Now Tyndale presented his letter
of introduction to Sir Harry Guildford, and freely
stated his purpose of rendering the Scriptures into
English. As a proof of his ability to perform this
task, Tyndale submitted a translation of Isocrates.
“I should be pleased to become chaplain to the
Bishop of London; will you beg him to accept this
trifle? Isocrates ought to be an excellent recommendation
to a scholar; will you please to add
yours?”</p>

<p>“Sir Harry Guildford,” says Tyndale, “willed me
to write an epistle to my lord, and go to him
myself; which I also did, and delivered my epistle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
to a servant of his own, one William Hebilthwayte,
a man of mine own acquaintance.... But God
(which knoweth what is within hypocrites) saw that
I was beguiled, and that that counsel was not the
next way to my purpose. And therefore he gat
me no favour in my lord’s sight, whereupon my
lord answered me, his house was full, and advised
me to seek in London, where he said I could not
lack a service. And so in London I abode almost
a year, and marked the course of the world, and
heard our praters (I would say preachers) how they
boasted themselves and their high authority; and
beheld the pomps of our prelates, and how busy
they were, as they yet are, to set peace and unity
in the world, and saw things whereof I defer to
speak at this time, and understood at the last not
only that there was no room in my lord of London’s
palace to translate the New Testament, but also that
there was no place to do it in all England, as experience
doth now openly declare.”</p>

<p>Thus were Tyndale’s hopes of patronage from the
Bishop of London utterly disappointed. But God
had not deserted him, and He had already provided
a benefactor for His servant. Humphrey Monmouth,
a wealthy merchant of London, who resided in
Barking (which was at that time considered to be
the extreme east end of London), happened to be
in St. Dunstan’s in the West when Tyndale preached
there. Moved by one of those inexplicable impulses
which are really the influence of God’s Spirit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
Monmouth invited Tyndale to his house, and there
he remained for six months. His host thus speaks
of the guest whose character he thus had ample
opportunity of studying: “He lived like a good
priest, as me thought. He studied most part of
the day and of the night at his book, and he would
eat but sodden meat by his good will, nor drink
but small single beer. I never saw him wear linen
about him in the space he was with me. I did
promise him ten pounds sterling to pray for my
father and mother, their souls, and all Christian
souls; I did pay it to him when he made his exchange
at Hamboro’. Afterwards he got of some
other men ten pounds sterling more, the which he
left with me.”</p>

<p>Sir Thomas More, although a bitter enemy to
Tyndale, confessed that “before he went over the
sea, he was well known for a man of right good
living, studious, and well learned in Scripture, and
looked and preached holily.”</p>

<p>Of Sir Humphrey Monmouth, Latimer relates an
anecdote that cannot, though familiar, be well omitted
here. When preaching before King Edward, Latimer
said that a friend of his “knew in London a great
rich merchant, which merchant had a very poor
neighbour; yet, for all his poverty, he loved him
very well, and lent him money at his need, and let
him to come to his table whensoever he would. It
was even at that time when Doctor Colet was in
trouble, and should have been burnt, if God had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
turned the King’s heart to the contrary. Now the
rich man began to be a Scripture man; he began to
smell the Gospel: the poor man was a papist still.
It chanced on a time, when the rich man talked of
the Gospel, sitting at his table, where he reproved
popery and such kind of things, the poor man, being
then present, took a great displeasure against the
rich man; insomuch that he would come no more
to his house, he would borrow no money of him,
as he was wont to do before-times; yea, and conceived
such hatred and malice against him, that he
went and accused him before the Bishops. Now,
the rich man, not knowing any such displeasure,
offered many times to talk with him, and to set him
at quiet; but it would not be: the poor man had
such a stomach, that he would not vouchsafe to
speak with him; if he met the rich man in the
street, he would go out of his way. One time it
happened that he met him so in a narrow street,
that he could not avoid but come near him; yet for
all that, this poor man had such a stomach against
the rich man, I say, that he was minded to go forward,
and not to speak with him. The rich man
perceiving that, catcheth him by the hand, and
asked him, saying, ‘Neighbour, what is come into
your heart, to take such displeasure with me?
What have I done against you? Tell me, and I
will be ready at all times to make you amends.’
Finally, he spake so gently, so charitably, so lovingly
and friendly, that it wrought so in the poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
man’s heart, that by-and-by he fell down upon his
knees and asked him forgiveness. The rich man
forgave him, and so took him again to his favour;
and they loved as well as ever they did afore. Many
one would have said, ‘Set him in the stocks; let
him have bread of affliction and water of tribulation.’
But this man did not so. And here you see an
ensample of the practice of God’s words in such
sort, that the poor man, bearing great hatred and
malice against the rich man, was brought, through
the lenity and meekness of the rich man, from his
error and wickedness to the knowledge of God’s
Word. I would you would consider this ensample
well, and follow it.”</p>

<p>This tender-hearted man was also a great patron
of men of letters, and probably it was at his table
that Tyndale was advised by some unknown friend
to go abroad. Upon the Continent he might reasonably
hope to complete his translation, and to print
it without molestation. Without knowing that he
thereby doomed himself to exile which would only
terminate in his martyrdom, and yet not shrinking
from the ordeal, Tyndale left England in the month
of May 1524, and sailed thence to Hamburg. No
one observed with interest the austere, nervous man
as he gazed for the last time upon his native land,
but his voyage was of far more importance to England,
and to the world, than any event of the
period. Europe watched with mingled feelings
Luther’s heroic stand, and the German Reformer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
was never at any time of his life without many
friends who stood steadily beside him in his time
of peril. With the exception of Monmouth, who
only with much difficulty saved himself from death,
Tyndale had no sympathy or helper at all; but,
without complaining of this isolation, he went forward
with true national persistence in the path of
duty. He himself and his work were of such a
character that they could not be adequately appreciated
then, but long after Wolsey and his hat
(to which the nobility bowed, and before which
candles were burned) are forgotten, the work of
Tyndale will be appreciated, and will exert a
powerful influence in the lives of millions through
the eternity that is yet to come.</p>

<p>HELPED BY LUTHER—FINDING A COMPANION—A BOLD
VENTURE—DRIVEN AWAY—BURNING THE BIBLE DOES
NOT DESTROY IT.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hamburg</span>, as a centre of commercial activity, afforded
a singularly good hiding-place for Tyndale, and it
was also a most suitable port from whence he could
send the Bible when printed into England. It is
indeed, doubtful as to what his movements were;
he may have remained for a year in Hamburg, or, as
some have supposed, Tyndale may have left it upon a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
visit elsewhere. Monmouth says that after Tyndale
left England, “within a year he sent for his ten
pounds to me from Hamburg, and thither I sent it
to him.” Foxe supplements this information by the
statement that, “on his first departing out of the
realm, Tyndale took his journey into the further
parts of Germany, as into Saxony, where he had
conference with Luther and other learned men.”
And Tyndale’s great enemy, Sir Thomas More, said
that “Tyndale, as soon as he got him hence from
England, got him to Luther straight;” and adds
“that at the time of his translation of the New
Testament, Tyndale was with Luther at Wittemberg,
and the confederacy between him and Luther was
well known.” It seems, therefore, probable that
almost immediately after his landing at Hamburg,
Tyndale made his way to Wittemberg. His
admiration of Luther would be a quite sufficient inducement
to lead him to take this step, and perhaps
also his sense of loneliness and desolation influenced
him. Upon the exile himself the effect of
the visit must have been most beneficial. Demaus
says: “For Tyndale thus to come into contact
with the strong, joyous faith of Luther, to hear his
lion voice echoing through the crowded University
Church of Wittemberg, or to listen to his wonderful
table-talk as he sipped his beer in friendly social
intercourse, would be to have his whole soul inspired
with courage, bravely to do whatever duty God had
called him to, and to learn to repose with implicit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
confidence in the protection of the Divine Master
whom he served.”</p>

<p>Here, in Wittemberg, Tyndale, it would seem,
obtained a companion, one William Roye, who, however,
proved to be a fickle, irrepressible bore, a man
who must have inflicted acute torture upon his companion.
But his help was a necessity if the Bible
were to be speedily translated, and Tyndale had no
choice whatever; it must be either Roye or no translation;
and Tyndale suppressed all personal feeling
in the matter. Roye’s part in the translation was,
of course, quite mechanical and subordinate, but
in the laborious physical work of transcribing Roye
was helpful to Tyndale.</p>

<p>“Imagination,” says Dr. Stoughton of the after-life
of the two at Cologne, “can picture the two
men, influenced by far different motives, at work in
the far-famed city on the banks of the Rhine, in
some poor-looking house in an obscure street, while
a priest or a pilgrim passed under the windows on
their way to the shrine of the Three Kings, little
dreaming of the kind of employment going on there,
and of the consequences to which it would lead.”</p>

<p>In the spring of 1525 Tyndale went to Hamburg,
as we have seen, in order to obtain the money that
had been sent to him from London. From Hamburg,
Tyndale, accompanied by Roye, went to
Cologne, and now the New Testament which had
been translated was put into the press. Tyndale
was prepared to venture upon an edition of six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
thousand copies, but the printers were only willing
to undertake half that number. The book was to
be an octavo, and for a time the enterprise prospered
and all went well. But a busybody, one
John Cochlæus, who was at that time in Cologne,
by some means or another obtained a hint as to
the possible peril. He relates the incident with
intense self-complacency, as if it were something
to boast of. He says:—</p>

<p>“Having become intimate and familiar with the
Cologne printers, he (Cochlæus) sometimes heard them
confidently boast, when in their cups, that, whether
the King and Cardinal of England would or not, all
England would in a short time be Lutheran. He
heard, also, that there were two Englishmen lurking
there, skilful in languages, and fluent, whom, however,
he never could see or converse with. Calling,
therefore, certain printers into his lodging, after they
were heated with wine, one of them, in more private
discourse, discovered to him the secret by which
England was to be drawn over to the side of Luther,
namely, that three thousand copies of the Lutheran
New Testament, translated into the English language,
were in the press, and already were advanced
as far as the letter K, <i>in ordine quarternionem</i>; that
the expenses were wholly supplied by English merchants,
who were secretly to convey the work, when
printed, and to disperse it widely through all England,
before the King or the Cardinal could discover
or prohibit it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>“Cochlæus being inwardly affected by fear and
wonder, disguised his grief, under the appearance of
admiration. But another day considering with himself
the magnitude of the grievous danger, he cast
in mind by what method he might expeditiously
obstruct these very wicked attempts. He went,
therefore, secretly, to Herman Rinck, a patrician of
Cologne, and military knight, familiar both with the
Emperor and the King of England, and a Councillor,
and disclosed to him the whole affair, as, by means
of the wine, he had received it. He, that he might
ascertain all things more certainly, sent another
person into the house where the work was printing,
according to the discovery of Cochlæus, and when
he had understood from him that the matter was
even so, and that there was great abundance of
paper there, he went to the senate, and so brought
it about that the printer was interdicted from proceeding
further in that work. The two English
apostates, snatching away with them the quarto
sheets printed, fled by ship going up the Rhine to
Worms, where the people were under the full rage
of Lutheranism, that there, by another printer, they
might complete the work begun.”</p>

<p>Roye found a relief for his vexation in abusing
Cochlæus, whom he calls—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“A little, praty, foolish poade,</div>
<div class="indent">But although his stature be small,</div>
<div class="indent">Yet men say he lacketh no gall,</div>
<div class="verse">More venomous than any toad.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Tyndale probably felt this hindrance to his work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
far more keenly than Roye did, but he was not the
man to descend to abuse. He probably closed his
lips with a firmer resolve than ever to persevere in
spite of all obstacles, and to thus avenge himself upon
his adversaries. At Worms it would appear that
Tyndale laid aside the quarto edition which had been
so rudely interrupted, and that he there began to print
an octavo edition of the New Testament. About the
spring of 1526 the Testaments were not only ready,
but they were in England, and they began at once
to be circulated. They there commanded a wholesale
price of thirteenpence per copy, and were retailed
at about thirtypence per volume. Of course, it
must be remembered that the present value of
money is fifteen times more than it was at the
period under consideration.</p>

<p>Not only had Cochlæus warned Henry and
Wolsey of the intended act of atrocity, but Lee,
who was King Henry’s almoner, also wrote to
England to say what he had heard of Tyndale’s
doings. He urged the King to persecute these
criminals to the utmost, and thus to preserve his
kingdom from danger. Henry required but little
persuasion to become a persecutor, but the Bishops
were determined to make his obedience quite sure.
The Bishop of St. Asaph laid the matter before
Wolsey, and he called a council of prelates to
advise as to what was to be done about these
dreadful books. Roye thus represents the discussion
in a jingling poem that he published:—</p>

<p>Two priests’ servants, named Watkyn and Jeffraye,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
are supposed to be conversing about the
Testaments, and they discourse thus:—</p>

<p>Tunstal preached at St. Paul’s Cross at this burning
of the Testament, and yet the people read the
book, which continued to be circulated in spite of
the priests. Tunstal thereupon further issued an
injunction in which he ordered all copies of the
Testament to be surrendered to him on pain of
excommunication. But although the Archbishop of
Canterbury also issued a similar mandate, the books
continued to be sold and to be read, although in
secret. Nay more, the printers of Antwerp, encouraged
by the enormous demand for Testaments that
had arisen, afterwards printed a large supply upon
their own account, and, further, succeeded in smuggling
them into England. In sublime ignorance of
the law of supply and demand, the Bishops then
resolved to purchase these Testaments in order to
destroy them. The aged Archbishop of Canterbury<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
expended a sum amounting to nearly £1000, at the
present value of money, for this purpose, but Tunstal
is the chief hero of the incident. Old Hall, the
chronicler, relates the event, which, though it occurred
later, may be most conveniently referred to here:—</p>

<p>“It happened that one Packington, a merchant
and mercer of London, was in Antwerp, and this
Packington was a man that highly favoured Tyndale,
but to the Bishop utterly showed himself to the
contrary. The Bishop commenced of the New Testaments,
and how he would gladly buy them.
Packington said to the Bishop, ‘My lord, I know
the Dutchmen and strangers that have bought them
of Tyndale and have them here to sell; so that if it
be your lordship’s pleasure to pay for them I will
then assure you to have every book of them that is
printed and here unsold.’ The Bishop said, ‘Do
your diligence and get them; and with all my heart I
will pay for them whatsoever they cost you.’ Packington
came to Tyndale and said, ‘William, I know
thou art a poor man, and hast a heap of New Testaments
by thee for the which thou hast both
endangered thy friends and beggared thyself, and I
have now gotten thee a merchant, which with ready
money shall despatch thee of all that thou hast.’
‘Who is the merchant?’ said Tyndale. ‘The
Bishop of London.’ ‘Oh, that is because he will
burn them,’ said Tyndale. ‘Yea, marry,’ quoth
Packington. ‘I am the gladder,’ said Tyndale, ‘for
these two benefits shall come thereof; I shall get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
the money to bring myself out of debt, and the
whole world will cry out against the burning of
God’s Word; and the overplus of the money that
shall remain to me shall make me more studious to
correct the said New Testament, and so newly print
the same once again, and I trust the second will
much better like you than ever the first.’ And
so, forward went the bargain: the Bishop had the
books, Packington had the thanks, and Tyndale had
the money.”</p>

<p>On 4th May 1530, therefore, at St. Paul’s Cross,
in the Churchyard, these Testaments were publicly
burned. Burnet says: “This burning had such a
baleful appearance in it, being generally called a
burning of the Word of God, that people from thence
concluded there must be a visible contrariety between
that book and the doctrines of those who kindled it,
by which both their prejudice against the clergy and
their desire of reading the New Testament were increased.”
Men said to one another that the book
“was not only faultless, but very well translated, and
was devised to be burnt because men should not be
able to prove such faults as were at Paul’s Cross
declared to have been found in it were never found
there indeed, but untruly surmised.”</p>

<p>Commenting in after-years upon the carping criticisms
that were passed on his work, Tyndale said:
“There is not so much as one <i>i</i> therein if it lack a
tittle over his head, but they have noted it, and
number it unto the ignorant people for an heresy.”</p>

<p>CURIOSITIES OF TRANSLATION—ANCIENT VERSIONS—THE
BOOK THAT TURNS THE HEART INSIDE OUT—TYNDALE’S
QUALIFICATIONS—HIS PUNGENT GLOSSES.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> pages may perhaps be devoted to those who
had preceded Tyndale in the work of translation,
but for all practical purposes, as it will be seen, they
were of no aid to the work of Tyndale.</p>

<p>As an example of the errors of translators a few
specimens may be subjoined, without any attempt at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
preserving the order of time. Although of a later
date, they indicate the difficulties that beset the
work and the dangers into which the unwary were
liable to fall.</p>

<p>Among singular editions of the Scriptures there
is one that was printed in London in 1551, and
which is called the Bug Bible because Ps. xci. 5 is
printed, “Thou shalt not be afraid of the bugges by
night.”</p>

<p>In 1561 an edition of the Bible was printed at
Geneva; it is called the Breeches Bible because of
its translating Gen. ii. 7 thus: “They sewed fig-leaves
together and made themselves breeches.” But
this was also done by an edition printed in 1568, in
which also Jer. viii. 22 is rendered, “Is there no
treacle in Gilead?” This word treacle was afterwards
altered into rosin, and in 1611 rosin gave
place to balm.</p>

<p>In one edition of the Bible which was printed in
1717, the first line of Luke xx. is misprinted into
“The parable of the vinegar” instead of “The
parable of the vineyard.”</p>

<p>It is evident that God left much to the learning
and common-sense of the men who translated the
Scriptures, and yet He has so overruled things, that,
upon the whole, no serious mistake has long continued
in the Book of Truth. Yet, as an instance
of the need of care, we are told that Eliot, the
apostle of the Indians, when translating the Scriptures
required the Indian word for lattice in Judges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
v. 28. He crossed his fingers to represent a lattice
and asked one and another what word that meant.
They told him, and he put it into his Bible. But
when he acquired more of the language he found
that he had actually said, “The mother of Sisera
looked out of a window and cried through the eel
pots.” Now, as language constantly changes, there
thence arises a need for a continuous revision of the
translation. In our English tongue, for example,
all-to once meant altogether or entirely; anon meant
immediately; bravery meant finery and not courage;
carriage stood for baggage or that which could be
carried by the hand. As men constantly change
their speech, it is evident that we must vary the
translation, if it is to be the living voice of God to
men.</p>

<p>The Scriptures probably reached England with the
Roman army, and they probably penetrated thence
into Scotland. Of course, they were in Latin. The
earliest attempt to render this Latin Bible into
Saxon was that of Cædmon, a monk of Whitby, who
lived about the seventh century. His work was
indeed more of a paraphrase than anything else.
The same may be said of what are called Alfred’s
Dooms, which were a free translation of the Ten
Commandments by that King.</p>

<p>In the British Museum there is the celebrated
Durham Book. It is most beautifully written, and
is also ornamented by curious portraits of the evangelists
and others. Among other stories that are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
related of this book, it is said that the monks of
Lindisfarne were once flying from the Danes; their
ship was upset and the Durham Book fell into the
sea. But through the merits of the patron saint,
the tide ebbed out much farther than usual, and the
book was found three miles from the shore, lying
upon the sands, but unhurt by the waves! It was
thereupon placed in the inner lid of St. Cuthbert’s
coffin, where it was afterwards found when, in 1104,
the monks settled at Durham and built the Cathedral.
This book is a Latin text, beneath which
two hundred years later an interesting Anglo-Saxon
translation was added.</p>

<p>Of translations proper the earliest we know of is
that of the Venerable Bede, who died in 735. He
was a monk of Jarrow, on the banks of the Tyne,
and there his shattered high-backed chair is still
preserved.</p>

<p>He is said to have been one of the most learned
men of his time; to which fact we may attribute
the legend that once while he was preaching the
stones cried out, “Amen, Venerable Bede!”</p>

<p>An eye-witness has left us an account of his
closing days. The scribe was writing the translation
from the dictation of the dying man, when, as
he finished the last verse of the twentieth chapter,
he exclaimed, “There remains now only one chapter;
but it seems difficult for you to speak.” “It
is easy,” said Bede; “take your pen, dip it in ink,
and write as fast as you can.” And he did so as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
rapidly as might be, for life was ebbing fast from
the venerable teacher. “Now, master, now, only
one sentence is wanting.” Bede repeated it. “It
is finished,” said the writer, laying aside his goose-quill.
“It is finished,” said Bede. “Lift up my
head; let me sit in my cell, in the place where I
have been accustomed to pray; and now glory be
to the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost.”
And so he passed away! His work was done;
other men could copy his translation, and the Book
that never dies could tell the sweet story of old to
men who were then unborn!</p>

<p>One is reminded of Moffat’s story after that he
had rendered the Word of God into the Sechwana
tongue. When the heathen beheld the converts
reading the new book, they inquired “if their friends
talked to the book.” “No,” was the answer; “it
talks to us; for it is the Word of God.” “What,
then,” was the astonished question, “does it speak?”
“Yes,” said the Christian, “it speaks to the heart.”
It indeed became a proverb among this African
people that the Bible turned their hearts inside out!
This is its privilege and function; it speaks to the
heart, and it turns the heart inside out!</p>

<p>The Reformers were accustomed to point to the
Anglo-Saxon versions as an argument against the
Church of Rome, who then permitted what she
afterwards forbade!</p>

<p>Sir Frederick Madden says, though, of several
MSS. of Anglo-Saxon Gospels that are still in existence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
“None appear to give the version in its
original purity.”</p>

<p>“It is very remarkable,” says Dr. Stoughton,
“that the Psalms have in all ages drawn towards
them the affections of devout minds, and have been
a true cardiphonia to mankind in general, so that in
this fact we have a satisfactory answer to objections
brought against them in modern times.” It is no
wonder, therefore, that more attention was paid to
them than to other parts of the Sacred Book, just
as a correct instinct leads men now to bind up the
Psalms with the Gospels.</p>

<p>We pass now to John Wycliffe, the morning
star of the Reformation. It is indeed difficult to
estimate the magnitude of his wonderful work. All
men could see the evil of Romanism, but he alone
saw the true remedy, and that was the Book of
God in the speech of the people!</p>

<p>He was born about 1320, in Yorkshire, and died
at Lutterworth in 1384. The carved oak pulpit in
which he preached, the plain oak table upon which
he wrote, the rude oak chair in which he sat, the
robe he used to wear, are all preserved in the little
town of Lutterworth, in the church of St. Mary, on
the bank of the river Swift. Of this church he had
been appointed rector by King Edward, as a reward
for his services as ambassador when he met the representative
of the Pope at Bruges. This was in 1374.</p>

<p>“One loves to picture this remarkable man pursuing
his Biblical toils, now in his Lutterworth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
rectory, then in his college at Oxford, working in the
winter nights by his lamp, and early in the summer’s
morn as the sun beamed through his window. We
see him with his long grey beard sometimes alone
bending over the parchment manuscript, carefully
writing down some well-laboured rendering; and
sometimes in company with others who sympathised
in his sentiments and loved to aid him in his hallowed
enterprise.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>He is supposed to have commenced his work
about 1378, and to have finished it about 1380,
though the latter date is by some assigned to the
New Testament alone. He began with a translation
of the Book of Revelation; then came the Gospels
in English with a commentary, and the other sacred
books followed at unknown periods. This translation
was from the Latin Vulgate by Jerome. It
was multiplied and widely read by the people;
preachers went up and down the country explaining
it to the crowds who attended them; it seemed,
indeed, as if the Reformation were to come in the
fourteenth century instead of two hundred years
later. But, just as in spring we often see a frost nip
off the plentiful blossoms, so persecution put back
the fair promise of fruit for a long time.</p>

<p>An attempt was made to destroy these translations
of the Scripture, and yet, in spite of the many
which were then destroyed, nearly 170 MSS. of
this period remain to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>After escaping the malice of his enemies, Wycliffe
died at home. “Admirable,” says Fuller, “that a
hare so often hunted with so many packs of dogs
should die at last quietly sitting upon his form.”
The Council of Constance, in the next century,
after burning Wycliffe’s disciple Huss, ordered that
Wycliffe’s bones should be disinterred and burned,
and with contemptible spite they further decreed
that the ashes were to be thrown into the river
Swift. “Thus,” says Fuller, “this brook hath conveyed
his ashes into Avon, Avon into Severn, Severn
into the narrow seas, they into the main ocean.
And thus the ashes of Wycliffe are the emblems
of his doctrine, which now is dispersed all the
world over.” John Purvey or Purnay, who had
lived with Wycliffe, revised his master’s work. It
was Purvey who first termed the Sacred Book by
its now familiar name of Bible.</p>

<p>This version had even a wider circulation than
the first, and from its influence arose the Lollard
movement. This was both a religious and a political
revolution; it was an attempt to obtain reform both
in the Church and in the State. It was a movement
of all ranks, even among monks and nuns—alas!
without success.</p>

<p>In 1408 a Convocation at Oxford enacted a law
which forbade a translation of Scriptures into English,
and warned all persons against reading such
books under penalty of excommunication.</p>

<p>At this time a New Testament was worth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
£2, 16s. 8d., or about £45, 6s. 8d. of our money!
At this period we are told that a decent, respectable
man could live well upon £5 per year. Writing was
tedious, slow, liable to error, and expensive, so that the
number of copies were limited; but about 1440 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>,
or sixty years after Wycliffe, the printing-press was
invented. One of the first books that were printed
was a Latin Bible; one of this edition was sold
some years ago for £3400; another realised £2000.</p>

<p>In 1477 William Caxton brought this new art
to England, and in Westminster Abbey he printed
books under the protection of King Edward IV.</p>

<p>We have thus sketched briefly the history of the
previous versions, and have come in the order of
time to Tyndale’s version of the Testament which
Tyndale translated under so many difficulties.
F. W. Faber (a Romanist) says:—“Who will say
that the uncommon beauty and marvellous English
of the Protestant Bible is not one of the strongholds
of heresy in this country? It lives on the ear like
music that can never be forgotten, like the sound of
church bells, which the convert hardly knows how he
can forego. Its felicities often seem to be almost
things rather than mere words. It is part of the
national mind, and the anchor of national seriousness.
Nay, it is worshipped with a positive idolatry, in extenuation
of whose gross fanaticism its intrinsic beauty
pleads availingly with the man of letters and the
scholar. The memory of the dead passes into it. The
potent traditions of childhood are stereotyped in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
phrases. The power of all the griefs and trials of a
man is hidden beneath its words. It is the representative
of his best moments; and all that there has been
about him of soft, and gentle, and pure, and penitent,
and good, speaks to him for ever out of his
English Bible. It is his sacred thing, which doubt
has never dimmed and controversy never soiled.
It has been to him all along as the silent, but oh
how intelligible! voice of his guardian angel; and
in the length and breadth of the land there is not a
Protestant with one spark of religiousness about him
whose spiritual biography is not in his Saxon Bible.”</p>

<p>To which may be added the testimony of the
present Bishop of Durham, who speaks of Tyndale’s
work thus: “In rendering the sacred text, he
remained throughout faithful to the instincts of a
scholar. From first to last his style and his interpretation
are his own; and in the originality of
Tyndale is included in a large measure the originality
of our English Version. For not only did Tyndale
contribute to it directly the substantial basis of half
the Old Testament (in all probability) and of the
whole of the New, but he established a standard of
Biblical translation which others followed. It is
even of less moment that by far the greater part of
his translation remains intact in our present Bibles,
than that his spirit animates the whole. He toiled
faithfully himself, and where he failed he left to
those who should come after the secret of success....
His influence decided that our Bible should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
be popular, and not literary, speaking in a simple
dialect, and that so, by its simplicity, it should be
endowed with permanence.”</p>

<p>Mr. Froude’s testimony may perhaps be added
here, not because it is requisite, but as the historian’s
tribute to a noble man: “Of the translation itself,
though since that time it has been many times
revised and altered, we may say that it is substantially
the Bible with which we are all familiar. The
peculiar genius—if such a word may be permitted—which
breathes through it, the mingled tenderness
and majesty, the Saxon simplicity, the preternatural
grandeur, unequalled, unapproached in the
attempted improvements of modern scholars, all are
here, and bear the impress of the mind of one man—William
Tyndale.”</p>

<p>As an example of this identity we take a
passage from Tyndale’s version; the words in italics
remain as Tyndale placed them in both the Authorised
and Revised Versions. The passage that we
select is Matt. xviii. 19-27:—</p>

<p>“<i>Again I say unto you, that if two of you shall
agree</i> in <i>earth</i> in <i>any</i> manner <i>thing</i> whatsoever <i>they
shall</i> desire, <i>it shall be</i> given <i>them of my Father which
is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together
in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</i></p>

<p>“<i>Then came Peter to him, and said</i>, Master, <i>how
oft shall my brother</i> trespass <i>against me and I</i> shall
<i>forgive him</i>? shall I forgive him <i>seven times</i>? <i>Jesus</i>
said <i>unto him, I say not unto thee seven times, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
seventy times seven</i> times. <i>Therefore is the Kingdom
of Heaven likened unto a certain King which would</i>
take account of <i>his servants. And when he had
begun to reckon, one was brought unto him which
owed him ten thousand talents: but</i> when <i>he had</i>
nought <i>to pay</i>, the <i>lord commanded him to be sold,
and his wife and his children and all that he had,
and payment to be made. The servant fell down and</i>
besought <i>him saying</i>, Sir, give <i>me</i> respite, <i>and I will
pay</i> it every whit. Then had <i>the Lord</i> pity on the
<i>servant</i> and loosed <i>him and forgave him the debt</i>.”</p>

<p>It has been estimated that there are not more
than 350 words in the whole book that are strange
to us now, so that Tyndale may be justly regarded
as one of the builders of our language.</p>

<p>Of the quarto testaments which were completed
at Worms, after the hurried flight from Cologne,
only one fragment remains, and that is deposited
in the British Museum. It consists of thirty-one
leaves only, and terminates at the 12th verse of the
22nd chapter of St. Matthew. It was discovered
in the year 1836 by a London bookseller bound up
with a tract by Æcolampadius. This fragment is
all that remains of the three thousand copies in
quarto that were commenced at Cologne and completed
at Worms.</p>

<p>Of the three thousand octavo Testaments which,
although commenced at Worms, were issued probably
before the quarto, one perfect copy is preserved
in the library of the Baptist College in Bristol.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
This book was purchased for the Earl of Oxford
about the year 1740, and he rewarded the agent
who discovered the treasure with a donation of ten
pounds, and an annuity of twenty pounds per year.
This latter annuity was paid for fourteen years, so that
the total cost of the book to the Earl was £290.
At the death of the Earl of Oxford, his library was
purchased by Osborne, the bookseller, for less money
than the bindings had cost their collector. Osborne,
in turn, sold the book for fifteen shillings; then it
came into the hands of Dr. Gifford, a Baptist minister,
who bequeathed it to the college in his native city.
In the same college, amongst many other Biblical
treasures and curiosities, is a copy of what is called
the Droll-Error Tyndale. It is a handsome volume,
well printed upon good paper, but full of printers’
blunders. Amongst them is that which has given
a name to the edition; thus, 2 Cor. x., instead of
“Let him that is such think on this wise,” the
printer has put “Let hym that is foche (long <i>s</i>)
think on his wyfe.” This book is supposed to be
later in date than either the octavo or quarto
editions, but it may be perhaps most conveniently
referred to here.</p>

<p>The spirit in which the work of translation was
undertaken by Tyndale appears in his prologue:—</p>

<p>“I have translated, brethren and sisters most
dear and tenderly beloved in Christ, the New Testament
for your spiritual edifying, consolation, and
solace, exhorting instantly, and beseeching those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
that are better seen in the tongues than I, and that
have higher gifts of grace to interpret the sense of
Scripture and the meaning of the Spirit than I, to
consider and ponder my labour, and that with the
spirit of meekness, if they perceive in any places
that I have not attained the very sense of the tongue
or meaning of the Scripture, or have not given the
right English word, that they put to their hands
to amend it, remembering that so is their duty to
do. For we have not received the gifts of God
for ourselves only or for to hide them, but for
to bestow them unto the honouring of God and
Christ, and edifying of the congregation which is
the body of Christ.”</p>

<p>Of Tyndale’s qualifications for his work there can
be no doubt whatever. Buschius, a distinguished
German scholar, speaks of him as “so skilled in
seven languages, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Italian,
Spanish, English, French, that whichever he spoke
you would suppose it his native tongue.”</p>

<p>The Greek text that he followed in his translation
was, of course, that which Erasmus had given
to the world, and although Tyndale was evidently
more familiar with the second, he now and then
uses the third edition. At the same time, it has
been shown by Demaus that, “as he proceeded in his
undertaking, Tyndale had before him the Vulgate,
the Latin version of Erasmus, and the German of
Luther, and that, in rendering from the original
Greek, he carefully consulted all these aids; but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
did so not with the helpless imbecility of a mere
tyro, but with the conscious independence of an
accomplished scholar.”</p>

<p>At the same time, it is but justice to bear in
mind that some of the alleged faults of our version are
due to Tyndale. For example, the manner in which
he translates the same Greek word differently in the
same connection, and sometimes in the same verse,
adds indeed to the beauty, but it diminishes the
force of the book.</p>

<p>But the most heinous offence in the eyes of the
Papists, after his translating the Scripture at all,
was the putting of notes in the margin.</p>

<p>Of these we select a few examples:—</p>

<p>“Whatsoever ye bind on earth shall be bound
in heaven;” Tyndale says, “Here <i>all</i> bind and
loose.” Beside the words, “If thine eye be single,
all thy body is full of light,” he writes, “The eye is
single when a man in all his deeds looketh but on
the will of God, and looketh not for land, honour, or
any other reward in this world; neither ascribeth
heaven nor a higher room in the heaven unto his
deeds: but accepteth heaven as a thing purchased
by the blood of Christ and worketh freely for love’s
sake only.”</p>

<p>“All good things cometh of the bountifulness,
liberality, mercy, promises, and truth of God by the
deserving of Christ’s blood only.”</p>

<p>“He that hath,” he thus expounds. “Where
the Word of God is understood, there it multiplieth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
and maketh the people better; where it is not
understood, there it decreaseth and maketh the
people worse.”</p>

<p>These notes, as we shall see, were subsequently
omitted, but it is easy to see that they were
calculated to give serious offence to the Romish
authorities.</p>

PENTATEUCH.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tyndale</span>, it is supposed, reached Worms after his
hurried flight to Cologne about October 1525, and
there he remained for two years. Until the following
April or May, he would be fully occupied with
the labour which the issuing of the three thousand
octavo and the three thousand quarto Testaments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
from the press involved. Immediately that this
was accomplished, he parted cheerfully from his
troublesome friend William Roye.</p>

<p>It has also been supposed that during his residence
in Worms, Tyndale gave himself to the study
of Hebrew, as a qualification for his work of translation.</p>

<p>In the year 1528 he left Worms for Marburg,
which, under the rule of Landgrave Philip, was
one of the most eminent of the Protestant cities
of Germany. Here the work of the Reformation
had been more thorough than in any other part
of the Empire, as the Landgrave himself was a
believer in Zwingle’s doctrine. Here Tyndale was
both in safety, and yet in the society of learned
men, who were able to assist him in his arduous
enterprise. For the Landgrave had done his very
utmost to attract men of piety and letters to his
capital, and the reformed flocked to it as to a second
metropolis of religion, and as next to Wittemberg.
Here Tyndale met with the heroic Patrick Hamilton
and other young men from Scotland, and here, also,
he conversed with Barnes, who was then a fugitive
from the Papal persecution which still raged in
England. Sir Thomas More declared that Barnes
then induced Tyndale to abandon the Lutheran
view of the Sacrament, and his testimony is probably
correct. In his Confutation he says:—</p>

<p>“Friar Barnes was of Zwinglia’s sect against the
sacrament of the altar, believing that it is nothing but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
bare bread. But Tyndale was yet at that time not
fully fallen so far in that point, but though he were
bad enough beside, he was yet not content with
Friar Barnes for holding of that heresy. But within
a while after, as he that is falling is soon put
over, the Friar made the fool mad outright, and
brought him down into the deepest dungeon of
that devilish heresy wherein he sitteth now fast
bounden in the chair of pestilence with the chain
of pertinacity.”</p>

<p>The diction and the spirit are certainly not to be
commended, but Sir Thomas More sometimes endeavoured
to compensate for a bad cause by virulent
abuse. We shall have occasion to refer again to
some of his coarse expressions with regard to the
Reformers, and, therefore, we now only notice the
fact that, while at Marburg, Tyndale adopted the
Zwinglian view of the Sacrament. But a better
companion than Barnes now came to comfort and
sustain him; he was John Fryth, whom Tyndale
called “his own son in the faith.”</p>

<p>In him Tyndale found a man after his own heart,
and the intercourse of the two friends was probably
a mutual joy.</p>

<p>About the time of Fryth’s arrival in Marburg,
Tyndale issued a book which created as great a
sensation in England as his Testament had done.
This was the book which is generally known as “The
Wicked Mammon,” or more fully, “The Parable of
the Wicked Mammon.” “The Wicked Mammon”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
is really an exposition of the parable of the Unjust
Steward. Tyndale’s main purpose in the book, however,
was to set forth the cardinal doctrine of Justification
by Faith, but in doing so he naturally assailed
the gross errors of Rome.</p>

<p>In his preface Tyndale boldly declares the Pope
to be Antichrist, an assertion which required much
courage at the time, and said:—</p>

<p>“We had spied out Antichrist long ago if we had
looked in the doctrine of Christ and His apostles;
where, because the least seeth himself now to be
sought for, he roareth and seeketh new holes to hide
himself in; and changeth himself into a thousand
fashions with all manner of vileness, falsehood,
subtlety, and craft. Because that his excommunications
are come to light, he maketh it treason unto
the King to be acquainted with Christ. If Christ
and they may not reign together, one hope we have—that
Christ shall live for ever. The old Antichrists
brought Christ unto Pilate, saying, ‘By our
law He ought to die;’ and when Pilate bade them
judge Him after their law, they answered, ‘It is not
lawful for us to kill any man;’ which they did to the
intent that they which regarded not the shame of
their false communications should yet fear to confess
Christ, because that the temporal sword had condemned
Him. They do all things of a good zeal,
they say; <i>they love you so well, that they had rather
burn you than that you should have fellowship with
Christ</i>. They are jealous over your armies, as saith<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
St. Paul. They would divide you from Christ and
His Holy Testament, and join you to the Pope to
believe in his testament and promise.”</p>

<p>The New Testament had been issued without
Tyndale’s name upon it, but at length the secret of
his authorship had leaked out. Now with a sublime
scorn both for the prelates and for their malice,
Tyndale continues:—</p>

<p>“Some men will ask peradventure why I take the
labour to make this work, inasmuch as they will
burn it, seeing they burnt the Gospel? I answer,
<i>In burning the New Testament they did none other
thing than that I looked for</i>; <span class="allsmcap">NO MORE SHALL THEY
DO IF THEY BURN ME ALSO; IF IT BE GOD’S WILL, IT
SHALL SO BE</span>.”</p>

<p>Then Tyndale concludes his preface thus:—“Nevertheless,
in translating the New Testament I
did my duty, and so do I now, and will do as much
more as God hath ordained me to do. And as I
offered that to all men to correct it whosoever
could, even so I do this. Whosoever, therefore,
readeth this, compare it unto the Scriptures. If
God’s Word bear record unto it, and thou feelest in
thine heart that it is so, be of good comfort and
give God thanks. If God’s Word condemn it, then
hold it accused, and so do with other doctrines; as
Paul counselleth his Galatians. Believe not every
spirit suddenly, but judge them by the Word of
God, which is the trial of all doctrine, and lasteth
for ever. Amen!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>“That precious thing which must be in the heart
ere a man can work any good work,” says Tyndale,
“is the Word of God which in the Gospel preacheth,
proffereth, and bringeth unto all that repent and
believe the favour of God in Christ. Whoso heareth
the Word and believeth it, the same is thereby
righteous. Therefore it is called the Word of life,
the Word of grace, the Word of health, the Word
of redemption, the Word of forgiveness, and the
Word of peace. For of what nature soever the
Word of God is, of the same nature must the
hearts be which believe thereon and cleave thereunto.
Now is the Word living, pure, righteous,
and true; and even so maketh it the hearts of
them that believe thereon.”</p>

<p>Upon the duty of every man to help and to love
his neighbour Tyndale is very emphatic, and his
teachings are beautifully illustrated by his own self-denying
life:—</p>

<p>“It is a wonderful love wherewith a man loveth
himself. As glad as I would be to receive pardon
of mine own life (if I had deserved death), so glad
ought I to be to defend my neighbour’s life, without
respect of my life or my goods. A man ought
neither to spare his goods, nor yet himself, for his
brother’s sake, after the example of Christ.”</p>

<p>He even goes so far as to say: “If thy neighbour
need, and thou help him not, being able, thou
withholdest his duty from him, and art a thief
before God.... Every Christian man to another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
is Christ Himself, and thy neighbour’s need hath as
good right in thy goods as hath Christ Himself,
which is heir and lord of all. And look what
thou owest to Christ, that thou owest to thy neighbour’s
need. To thy neighbour owest thou thine
heart, thyself, and all that thou hast and canst do....
Thus is every man that needeth thine help thy
father, mother, sister, and brother in Christ; even
as every man that doeth the will of the Father is
father, mother, sister, and brother unto Christ.”</p>

<p>Probably no Christian teacher in that age would
have dared to have written such words as the following;
for the spirit of national hostility was very strong,
and the persecuting mania was terribly prevalent:—</p>

<p>“Moreover, if any be an infidel and a false Christian,
and forsake his household, his wife, children,
and such as cannot help themselves, then art thou
bound, if thou have therewith, even as much as to
thine own household. And they have as good
right in thy goods as thou thyself; and if thou
withdraw mercy from them, and hast wherewith to
help them, then art thou a thief. If thou show
mercy, so doest thou thy duty and art a faithful
minister in the household of Christ; and of Christ
shalt thou have thy reward and thanks.”</p>

<p>Such doctrine was far in advance of the age, but
it is interesting to notice how thus, as in some
other things, Tyndale was far ahead of his contemporaries.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with “The Wicked Mammon,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
Tyndale issued another work, which was almost of as
much importance to the Reformation as was his
Bible. It is entitled “The Obedience of a Christian
Man,” and is both a defence of the Reformers from
the charge of sedition, and also a call to them to
persist in the path of duty in spite of persecution.
“Adversity I receive at the hand of God is a
wholesome medicine, though it be somewhat bitter,”
said Tyndale.</p>

<p>“O Peter, Peter!” he exclaims when speaking
of the sins of the clergy, “thou wast too long a
fisher; thou wast never brought up at the Arches,
neither wast Master of the Rolls, nor yet Chancellor
of England.... The parson sheareth, the vicar
shaveth, the parish priest pilleth, the friar scrapeth,
and the pardoner pareth; we lack but a butcher
to pull the skin.”</p>

<p>He concludes with these noble words: “Remember
that Christ is the end of all things. He
only is our resting-place, He is our peace. For as
there is no salvation in any other name, so there is
no peace in any other name. Thou shalt never
have rest in thy soul, neither shall the worm of
conscience ever cease to gnaw thine heart, till thou
come at Christ; till thou hear the glad tidings, how
that God for His sake hath forgiven thee all freely.
If thou trust in thy works, there is no rest. Thou
shalt think, I have not done enough.... If thou
trust in confession then shalt thou think, Have I
told all?... Likewise in our holy pardons and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
pilgrimages gettest thou no rest. As pertaining to
good deeds, therefore, do the best thou canst, and
desire God to give strength to do better daily; but
in Christ put thy trust, and in the pardon and promises
that God hath made thee for His sake; and
on that rock build thine house and there dwell.”</p>

<p>Such words were well calculated to stimulate and
to comfort the persecuted, and it is, therefore, no
wonder that they introduced an element into English
religious life that was most important and unhappily
infrequent before. Bilney, for example, had recanted,
but after suffering long and acute distress
of mind, “he came at length to some quiet of conscience,
being fully resolved to give over his life for
the confession of that truth which before he had
denounced. He took his leave in Trinity Hall of
certain of his friends, and said he would go up to
Jerusalem.... And so, setting forth on his journey
toward the celestial Jerusalem, he departed from
thence to the anchoress in Norwich, and there gave
her a New Testament of Tyndale’s translation and
‘The Obedience of a Christian Man,’ whereupon he
was apprehended and carried to prison, there to
remain till the blind Bishop Nixe sent up for a
writ to burn him.”</p>

<p>Of Bainham, who was another who had abjured,
Foxe says that he “was never quiet in mind or
conscience until the time he had uttered his fall to
all his acquaintance and asked God and all the
world forgiveness. And the next Sunday after he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
came to St. Austin’s with the New Testament in
his hand in English and ‘The Obedience of a
Christian Man’ in his bosom, and stood up there
before all the people in his pew, there declaring
openly, with weeping tears, that he had denied God.
After this he was strengthened above the cruel
death by fire with remarkable courage.”</p>

<p>This book came into the hands of the King
of England himself, and Strype thus relates the
incident: “Upon the Lady Anne Boleyn waited
a fair young gentlewoman named Mrs. Gaynsford;
and in her service was also retained Mr. George
Zouch, father to Sir John Zouch. This gentleman,
of a comely, sweet person, was a suitor in way of
marriage to the said young lady; and, among other
love-tricks, once he plucked from her a book in
English called Tyndale’s ‘Obedience,’ which the
Lady Anne had lent her to read. About which
time the Cardinal had given commandment to the
prelates, and especially to Dr. Simpson, Dean of the
King’s Chapel, that they should keep a vigilant eye
over all people for such books that they come not
abroad; that so, as much as might be, they might
not come to the King’s reading. But this which
he most feared fell out upon this occasion. For
Mr. Zouch was so ravished with the Spirit of God,
speaking now as well in the heart of the reader as
first it did in the heart of the maker of the book,
that he was never well but when he was reading
of that book. Mrs. Gaynsford wept because she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
could not get the book from her wooer, and he was
as ready to weep to deliver it. But see the providence
of God; Mr. Zouch, standing in the chapel
before Dr. Simpson, ever reading upon this book,
and the Dean, never having his eye off the book
in the gentleman’s hand, called to him, and then
snatched the book out of his hand, asked his name,
and whose man he was. And the book he delivered
to the Cardinal. In the meantime the Lady Anne
asketh her woman for the book. She on her knees
told all the circumstances. The Lady Anne showed
herself not sorry nor angry with either of the two.
But said she, ‘Well, it shall be the dearest book
that ever the Dean or Cardinal took away.’ The
noble woman goes to the King, and upon her knees
she desireth the King’s help for her book. Upon
the King’s token the book was restored. And
now bringing the book to him, she besought his
Grace most tenderly to read it. The King did so,
and delighted in the book; for saith he, ‘<i>This book
is for me and all Kings to read.</i>’ And in a little
time the King, by the help of this virtuous lady,
had his eyes opened to the truth, to search the
truth, to advance God’s religion and glory, to abhor
the pope’s doctrine, his lies, his pomp and pride, to
deliver his subjects out of the Egyptian darkness,
the Babylonian bonds, that the pope had brought
him and his subjects under.”</p>

<p>Wyatt repeats this story with some interesting
variations, for he says that Anne was “but newly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
come from the King, when the Cardinal came in
with the book in his hands to make complaints of
certain points in it that he knew the King would
not like of. And withal to take occasion with
him against those that countenanced such books in
general, and especially women, and as might be
thought with mind to go farther against the Queen
more directly, if he had perceived the King agreeable
to his meaning. But the King, that somewhat
afore disliked the Cardinal, finding the notes the
Queen had made, all turned the more to hasten his
ruin which was also furthered on all sides.”</p>

<p>So that the Cardinal in reality digged a pit and
then stumbled into it; and Henry for once in his
life read and admired the faithful setting forth of
truth! Alas that Tyndale’s own obedience should
be unto death! But so it proved to be with him.</p>

<p>In 1530 Tyndale left Marburg and returned
once more to Hamburg. During the same year
he also published another book, which he entitled
“The Practice of Prelates.”</p>

<p>In this book occurs the famous similitude, which
we here subjoin:—</p>

<p>“And to see how our holy father the pope came up,
mark the ensample of an ivy-tree: first it springeth
out of the earth, and then awhile creepeth along by
the ground till it findeth a great tree; then it
joineth itself beneath alow into the body of the tree,
and creepeth up a little, and a little, fair and softly.
And, at the beginning, while it is yet thin and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
small, that the burthen is not perceived, it seemeth
glorious to garnish the tree in the winter, and to
bear off the tempests of the weather. But in the
mean season it thrusteth roots into the bark of the
tree to hold fast withal, and ceaseth not to climb up
till it be at the top, and above all. And then it
sendeth his branches along by the branches of the
tree, and overgroweth all, and waxeth great, heavy,
and thick; and sucketh the moisture so sore out of
the tree and his branches, that it choketh and stifleth
them. And then the foul stinking ivy waxeth
mighty in the stump of the tree, and becometh a
seat and a nest for all unclean birds, and for blind
owls which hawk in the dark, and dare not come
at the light.</p>

<p>“Even so the bishop of Rome, now called pope,
at the beginning crope along upon the earth, and
every man trod upon him in this world. But as
soon as there came a Christian emperor, he joined
himself into his feet and kissed them, and crope up
a little with begging, now this privilege, now that;
now this city, now that; to find poor people withal,
and the necessary ministers of God’s Word. And
he entitled the emperor with choosing the pope and
other bishops, and promoted in the spiritualty, not
whom virtue and learning, but whom the favour of
great men, commendeth; to flatter, to get friends
and defenders, withal.</p>

<p>“And the alms of the congregation, which was
the food and patrimony of the poor and necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
preachers, that he called St. Peter’s patrimony, St.
Peter’s rents, St. Peter’s lands, St. Peter’s right; to
cast a vain fear, and an heathenish superstitiousness
into the hearts of men, that no man should dare
meddle whatsoever came once into their hands, for
fear of St. Peter, though they ministered it never so
evil; and that they which should think it none alms
to give them any more (because they had too much
already) should yet give St. Peter somewhat (as
Nebuchadnezzar gave his god Baal), to purchase an
advocate and an intercessor of St. Peter, and that
St. Peter should, at the first knock, let them in.</p>

<p>“And thus, with flattering and feigning, and vain
superstition, under the name of St. Peter, he crept
up and fastened his roots in the heart of the emperor,
and with his sword climbed up above all his
fellowships, and brought them under his feet. And
as he subdued them with the emperor’s sword, even
so by subtilty and help of them (after that they
were sworn faithful) he climbed above the emperor,
and subdued him also, and made stoop unto his feet,
and kiss them another while. Yea, pope Cœlestinus
crowned the emperor Henry the Fifth, holding the
crown between his feet. And when he had put
the crown on, he smote it off with his feet again,
saying that he had might to make emperors, and
put them down again.</p>

<p>“And he made a constitution that no layman
should meddle with their matters, nor be in their
councils, or wit what they did; and that the pope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
only should call the council, and the empire should
but defend the pope, provided always that the council
should be in one of the pope’s towns, and where
the pope’s power was greater than the emperor’s;
then, under a pretence of condemning some heresy,
he called a general council, where he made one a
patriarch, another cardinal, another legate, another
primate, another archbishop, another bishop, another
dean, another archdeacon, and so forth, as we now
see. And as the pope played with the emperor, so
did his branches, his members, the bishops, play in
every kingdom, dukedom, and lordship: inasmuch
that the very heirs of them, by whom they came up,
hold now their lands of them, and take them for
their chief lords. And as the emperor is sworn to
the pope, even so every king is sworn to the bishops
and prelates of his realm; and they are the chiefest
in all parliaments; yea, they and their money, and
they that be sworn to them, and come up by them,
rule altogether.</p>

<p>“And thus the pope, the father of all hypocrites,
hath with falsehood and guile perverted the order of
the world, and turned the roots of the trees upward,
and hath put down the kingdom of Christ, and set
up the kingdom of the devil, whose vicar he is; and
hath put down the ministers of Christ, and hath set
up the ministers of Satan, disguised, yet in names, and
garments, like unto the angels of light and ministers
of righteousness. For Christ’s kingdom is not of the
world; and the pope’s kingdom is all the world.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>But Tyndale was not only active in his attack
upon error; he was not less indefatigable in promulgating
truth. For on the 17th of January in the
same year, 1530, he issued from the press his translation
of the Pentateuch. The notes in the margin
in this translation are even more vigorous than those
in the New Testament. Thus Tyndale says: “To
bless a man’s neighbour is to pray for him and to
wish him good, and not to wag two fingers over
him.” “If we answer not our prelates, when
they be angry even as they would have it, we must
to the fire without redemption or forswear God.”
Upon Exodus xxxiv. 20, “None shall appear before
Me empty,” Tyndale says, “That is a good text for
the pope.” To Balaam’s question, “How shall I
curse when God hath not cursed?” Tyndale notes,
“The pope can tell how.”</p>

<p>Such words are not to be considered without due
reflection as to the circumstances under which they
were written. Tyndale had been long an exile, and
he knew that plots had been again and again laid to
entrap him. Although for a time he might hope to
elude his persecutors, he well knew that eventually
he must fall a victim to their cruelty, as many others
had done before him. And he believed himself to
be called of God for the purpose of combating the
gigantic form of error that, like Apollyon, “straddled
right across” the King’s highway and withstood the
pilgrims in the way to the Celestial City. Yet,
although some may not approve of the notes, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
counsel that is given in the prologue to Genesis will
be read by all spiritual Christians with unqualified
approval:—</p>

<p>“Though a man had a precious jewel and rich,
yet if he wist not the value thereof, nor wherefore it
served, he were neither the better nor richer of a
straw. Even so, though we read the Scripture, and
babble of it never so much, yet if we know not the
use of it, and wherefore it was given, and what
is therein to be sought, it profiteth us nothing at all.
It is not enough, therefore, to read and talk of it
only, but we must also desire God, day and night
instantly, to open our eyes, and to make us understand
and feel wherefore the Scripture was given,
that we may apply the medicine of Scripture, every
man to his own sores; unless that we intend to be
idle disputers and brawlers about vain words, <i>ever
gnawing upon the bitter bark without, and never
attaining to the sweet pith within</i>.”</p>

<p>SIR THOMAS MORE THE ADVOCATE OF THE BISHOPS—TYNDALE’S
CRUSHING REPLY—MORE’S GROSS ABUSE AND
FOUL LANGUAGE—PUBLIC OPINION WITH TYNDALE.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Tyndale</span>, of course, was not suffered to continue his
labours unassailed, for no less an antagonist than Sir
Thomas More entered the lists against him. Whatever
may be More’s claims to admiration, it must
ever be considered to be a foul blot upon his character
that he assailed Tyndale with low, scurrilous
abuse. As early as the year 1728, Tunstal, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
polished Bishop of London (who had previously so
unceremoniously rejected Tyndale’s offer of service),
wrote to More inviting him to undertake the task
of stemming the tide of heretical books which, in
spite of his utmost endeavours, continued to flow
into England. “Forasmuch,” said the Bishop, “as
you can play the Demosthenes both in our native
tongue and in Latin, and are wont to be a most
zealous defender of Catholic truth in every assault,
you will never be able to make a better use of any
spare hours that you can redeem from your occupation,
than by publishing in our native tongue something
that will expose even to rude and simple
people the crafty malice of the heretics, and make
them better prepared against those impious enemies
of the Church.” Copies of the books to which he
was to reply were forwarded to More, and the
Chancellor was reminded of the example of his
monarch, who had won the title of Defender of the
Faith by his book against Luther. More readily
complied with this request, and after a year of study
he published a large volume which specified Luther
and Tyndale as his chief objects of attack. The
book is in the form of a dialogue, which is, of
course, a most convenient form of eluding an awkward
attack.</p>

<p>“Look on Tyndale,” says Sir Thomas More,
“how in his wicked book of ‘Mammon,’ and after
in his malicious book of ‘Obedience,’ he showed
himself so puffed up with the poison of pride,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
malice, and envy, that it is more than marvel that
the skin can hold together.... He knoweth that
all the fathers teach that there is the fire of
purgatory, which I marvel why he feareth so little,
as if he be at a plain point with himself to go
straight to hell.” Anderson, in his “Annals of the
Bible,” in speaking of this attack of More’s says:
“The English language has never been so prostituted
before Sir Thomas More took up the pen....
No solitary selected expressions can convey
an adequate idea of the virulence, not to say the
verbosity and fallacious reasoning, of this writer;”
and the majority of unbiassed readers will probably
endorse this severe verdict. Sir Thomas More’s
book was published in June 1529, and during the
spring of 1531 Tyndale published his reply to it—an
answer which must be admitted by all impartial
men to effectually dispose of More and his flimsy
attempts at reasoning.</p>

<p>The following extract from the section in which
Tyndale treats of ceremonies will furnish an example
of his rugged, earnest method of argument.
He says: “How cometh it that a poor layman,
having wife and twenty children, and not able to
maintain them, though all his neighbours know his
necessity, shall not get with begging for Christ’s
sake in a long summer’s day enough to maintain
them two days honestly; when if a disguised monster
come, he shall, with an hour’s lying in the pulpit,
get enough to maintain thirty or forty sturdy lubbers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
a month long, of which the weakest shall be as
strong in the belly when he cometh unto the manger,
as the mightiest porter in the custom-house, or the
best courser that is in the King’s stable?... Who
thinketh it as good a deed to feed the poor as to
stick up a candle before a post, or as to sprinkle it
with holy water?... As though God were better
pleased when I sprinkled myself with water, or
set up a candle before a block, than if I fed or
clothed, or helped at his need, him whom He so
tenderly loveth that He gave His own Son unto
the death for him, and commandeth me to love
him as myself.... Christ’s death purchased grace
for man’s soul, to repent of evil, and to believe in
Christ for remission of sins, and to love the law
of God, and his neighbour as himself. Which is
the true worshipping of God in the spirit; and
He died not to purchase such honour for unsensible
things, that man to his dishonour should do
them honourable service, and receive his salvation
of them.”</p>

<p>This is vigorous writing, and is well calculated
to answer its purpose; that is, of destroying the
subtleties by means of which More and other Romish
advocates endeavoured to deceive and to beguile the
unwary. So keenly did the Papal party feel the
importance of Tyndale’s book, that More was compelled,
in spite of all his many employments, to
attempt a rejoinder at once. This volume, upon
which he lavished great pains, More had to confess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
to be a failure; men did not read it and one does
not wonder at their reluctance. A specimen only
will suffice of this vaunted defence of the Papacy
upon the part of gentle Thomas More; in justice
to Tyndale, this and similar passages should be
remembered by all admirers of the Chancellor:—</p>

<p>“This devilish drunken soul (Tyndale!) doth
abominably blaspheme, and calleth them (<i>i.e.</i>, the
schoolmen) liars and falsifiers of Scripture, and
maketh them no better than draff. But this drowsy
drudge hath drunken so deep in the devil’s dregs,
that, unless he wake and repent himself, the sinner,
he may hap ere long to fall into the mashing
fat, and turn himself into draff, as of which the
hogs of hell shall feed upon, and fill their bellies
thereof.”</p>

<p>Nothing can justify the employment of such
language, and the offence appears to be the more
heinous when we remember that Tyndale was
at that time enduring poverty and exile, while
More was enjoying the emoluments of office and
the favour of the King and Bishops! To call such
a man as Tyndale “a hell-hound, one of those that
the devil hath in his kennel,” can never be defended
by any impartial reader, and our sympathies must
therefore be wholly given to Tyndale in the controversy,
as our judgment must also award the
palm of victory to him. To Tyndale the controversy
was one not merely of life and death, for he
viewed the question in its eternal issues. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
would not wonder if he used somewhat strong
language when he realised what the Papacy is in
itself, and what its treatment of men, even of its
adherents, means in degradation and defilement; but
such scurrilous language as More employs at once
stains his own character, and also shows his keen
consciousness of having a bad case.</p>

<p>ATTEMPTS TO INDUCE TYNDALE TO RETURN TO ENGLAND—THE
INTERVIEW IN THE MEADOW—TYNDALE’S PATHETIC
APPEAL AND HIS NOBLE OFFER.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> England, Thomas Cromwell, the hammerman, had
succeeded Wolsey in the supreme direction of affairs.
So long as he possessed the King’s ear, the Reformers
were secure of at least one friend, and Henry himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
was prosperous and successful so long as he
followed the guidance of his great Minister.</p>

<p>Cromwell was a politician and not a Reformer,
but all his instincts were in favour of those who
pleaded for an overthrow of the Papal corruptions
and tyranny. It is true that in pursuing his purpose
Cromwell now and then adopted measures
that cannot be defended, but his policy was, after
all, that which, if pursued systematically instead of
spasmodically, would have secured the independence
and prosperity of the realm. Cromwell took
Latimer into his favour, and endeavoured to employ
his preaching talents in the furtherance of his designs.
He now endeavoured to induce Tyndale to return
home to England, hoping possibly that the great
translator would also co-operate with him in working
out his plans. Stephen Vaughan, one of the English
envoys to the Low Countries, was the messenger who
was employed for this purpose; and at Cromwell’s instance
he wrote three letters to three different places
whence he supposed they might reach Tyndale.</p>

<p>This was in the year 1530; and the result of
Vaughan’s inquiries into the whereabouts and doings
of the Reformer was a high appreciation on his part
both of Tyndale’s abilities and character. “The
man is of greater knowledge than the King’s Highness
doth take him for,” wrote Vaughan to Cromwell,
“which well appeareth by his works. Would God
he were in England!”</p>

<p>Tyndale probably did not take the same view of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
the case as Vaughan, for about this time his brother
John in England was sentenced by the Star Chamber
to be exhibited in Cheapside upon horseback with
his face to the horse’s tail. John Tyndale was
further compelled to pay a considerable fine, and
this punishment was inflicted because he had sent
money and letters to his brother William Tyndale,
and had, moreover, committed the further enormity
of receiving and selling Testaments!</p>

<p>Tyndale had means of obtaining information as to
all these doings in England, and he was therefore
somewhat sceptical as to the good faith of Vaughan.
At last he consented to meet the English envoy,
and accordingly an interview took place between
them “without the gates of Antwerp, in a field lying
nigh to the same. At our meeting, ‘Do you not
know me?’ said this Tyndale. ‘I do not well
remember you,’ said I to him. ‘My name is
Tyndale,’ said he. ‘But, Tyndale,’ said I, ‘fortunate
be our meeting.’ Then said Tyndale, ‘Sir, I have
been exceeding desirous to speak with you—I am
informed that the King’s Grace taketh great displeasure
with me for putting forth of certain books
which I lately made in these parts, but especially
for the book named ‘The Practice of Prelates,’ whereof
I have no little marvel, considering that in it I did
but warn his Grace of the subtle demeanour of the
clergy of his realm towards his person, and of the
shameful abuses by them practised, not a little
threatening the displeasure of his Grace and weal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
of his realm; in which doing I showed and declared
the heart of a true subject, which sought
the safeguard of his Royal person, and weal of his
commons, to the intent that his Grace, thereof
warned, might, in due time, prepare his remedies
against the subtle dreams. <i>If for my pains therein
taken—if for my poverty—if for my exile out of my
natural country, and being absent from my friends—if
for my hunger, my thirst, my cold, the great danger
wherewith I am everywhere compassed—and finally,
if for innumerable other hard and sharp sicknesses
which I endure, not yet feeling their asperity, by
reason I hoped with my labours to do honour to God,
true service to my Prince, and pleasure to his commons</i>—how
is that his Grace, this considering, may either
by himself think, or by the persuasions of others
be brought to think, that in this doing I should not
show a pure mind, a true and incorrupt zeal, and
affection to his Grace?</p>

<p>“‘Was there in me any such mind when I warned
his Grace to beware of his Cardinal, whose iniquity
he shortly after proved? Doth this deserve hatred?
Again, may his Grace, being a Christian prince, be
so unkind to God, which hath commanded His Word
to be spread throughout the world, to give more faith
to wicked persuasions of men, who, contrary to that
which Christ expressly commandeth in His Testament,
dare say that it is not lawful for the people
to have the same in a tongue that they understand;
because the purity thereof should open men’s eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
to see their wickedness? <i>As I now am, very death
were more pleasant to me than life, considering man’s
nature to be such as can bear no truth.</i>’”</p>

<p>At a second interview Tyndale went further, and
said, “with water in his eyes,” as Vaughan observed,
“If it would stand with the King’s most gracious
pleasure to grant only a bare text of Scripture to
be put forth among his people, like as is put forth
among the subjects of the Emperor in these parts,
and of other Christian princes, <i>be it of the translation
of what person soever shall please his Majesty</i>, I
shall immediately make faithful promise <i>never to
write more, nor abide two days</i> in these parts after
the same; but immediately to repair into his realm,
and there most humbly submit myself at the feet
of his Royal Majesty, <i>offering my body to suffer what
pain or torture, yea, what death his Grace will, so that
this be obtained</i>. And till that time I will abide the
asperity of all chances, whatsoever shall come, and
endure my life, in as much pains as it is able to
bear and suffer.”</p>

<p>A third time Vaughan met Tyndale, and again
the envoy attempted in vain to induce him to
venture back into England. Tyndale knew Henry
too well to do so, and he was providentially kept
from making this rash experiment, for his work
was not as yet finished.</p>

<p>It is somewhat difficult to believe, with Demaus,
that King Henry was quite honourable in approving
or in permitting these negotiations. The almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
unanimous opinion of all, until quite recently, was,
that Henry was at least a consenting party to
Tyndale’s murder. To a man like Henry the life
of Tyndale was but of little moment; and, from his
treatment of others, it is probable that, had Tyndale
ventured to return home, even with the promised
security of the Royal word, he would have suffered
the fate that befell many good men about this time.
The rumours that reached Tyndale from time to
time would make him chary of trusting Henry’s
promise; and at the very period that Vaughan was
endeavouring to persuade Tyndale to confide in the
King, Tyndale knew that a fierce persecution was
racing in England against those who did not believe
and act in religious matters as the King and Convocation
were pleased to appoint.</p>

<p>For example, Tyndale would have heard that
William Tracy, a Gloucestershire gentleman, and a
former friend of his, had just before died, and that
his will, instead of the usual invocation of Mary
and of the saints, began thus:—</p>

<p>“First, and before all other things, I commit
myself to God and His mercy; believing, without
any doubt or mistrust, that by His grace, and the
merits of Jesus Christ, and by the virtue of His
passion and His resurrection, I have, and shall have,
remission of all my sins, and also resurrection of
body and soul, according as it is written: ‘I believe
that my Redeemer liveth, and that in the last day I
shall rise out of the earth, and in my flesh shall see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
my Saviour;’ this my hope is laid up in my bosom.
And, touching my soul, this faith is sufficient, as I
suppose, without any other man’s works or merits.
My confidence and belief is, that there is but one
God, and one Mediator between God and man,
which is Jesus Christ; so that I take none in
heaven nor in earth to be mediator between me
and God, but only Jesus Christ. All others be but
petitioners for receiving of grace, but none are able
to give influence of grace, and, therefore, I will not
bestow any part of my goods with an intent that
any man should say or do anything to help my
soul, for therein I trust only in the promises of
Christ. And touching the distribution of my temporal
goods, my purpose is, by the grace of God, to
bestow them to be accepted as the fruits of faith,
so that I do not suppose that my merit shall be by
the good bestowing of them, but my merit is the
faith of Jesus Christ only, by whom such works are
good. And we should ever consider that true saying,
that a good work maketh not a good man, but
a good man maketh a good work; for faith maketh
a man both good and righteous; ‘for a righteous
man liveth by faith, and whatsoever springeth not
of faith is sin’” (Rom. xiv.).</p>

<p>This will was condemned by Convocation as
“proud, scandalous, contradictory, impious, and
heretical,” and it was decreed that Tracy’s body
should be exhumed and cast out of consecrated
ground as a heretic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>This dishonour to the dead was not the only proof
of active hostility that the clergy and King manifested,
for even the living were compelled to feel
their vengeance. No wonder is it, when he heard
of such things as the martyrdom of Bilney and
of others, that Tyndale feared to return to England,
even if he had the guarantee of the King’s
word. And yet he declared that he was ready to
do so if only the King would permit a translation
of the Scriptures to be circulated in England; to
secure this boon for his fellow-countrymen Tyndale
was quite content to die. Alas! the Bible was not
to be as yet circulated in England.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Vaughan</span>, who during the interviews of which we
have spoken had become strongly attached to Tyndale,
was recalled by Cromwell in 1532, and a less
scrupulous envoy was employed in his place. Sir
Thomas Elyot, the new tool of Henry’s policy, did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
not seek for a friendly interview with Tyndale, as
his predecessor had done; but, on the contrary, he
sought by all possible means to apprehend the
exile. Whether this indicated a change in the
King’s intention toward Tyndale, or were merely an
unmasking of purposes which it had been deemed
expedient to dissemble while Vaughan was the
envoy, the danger to Tyndale was equally as great.
“I gave many rewards,” Elyot wrote to Cromwell,
“partly to the Emperor’s servants to get knowledge,
and partly to such as by whose means I trusted to
apprehend Tyndale, according to the King’s commandment.”</p>

<p>Encompassed as he thus was with snares and
perils, Tyndale, however, did not desist from his
heroic efforts. He eluded Elyot’s plots, and successfully
translated and published the Book of Jonah,
and even prefixed his initials to the preface, as he
had not done with the New Testament. So successful,
however, were the efforts of the Papists to
suppress this book, that for a long time no copy of it
was known to be in existence; but in the year 1861
one was unexpectedly discovered in an old library.
The Book of Jonah furnished Tyndale with a
theme whereon he preached important truths to his
fellow-countrymen. Nineveh he made a parable
of England; and, as did Jonah, Tyndale preached
the need of immediate repentance.</p>

<p>“Christ, to preach repentance,” he wrote, “is
risen once more out of His sepulchre, in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
pope had buried Him, and kept Him down with his
pillars and pole-axes and all disguisings of hypocrisy,
with guile, wiles, and falsehood, and with the
sword of all princes, which he had blinded with his
false merchandise. And as I doubt not of the ensamples
that are past, so am I sure that great wrath
will follow except repentance turn it back again and
cease it.”</p>

<p>Beside this translation of Jonah, Tyndale also
issued an “Exposition of the First Epistle of St.
John” during the same year. From this “Exposition”
we extract the following passage:—</p>

<p>“Preaching of the doctrine which is light,” says
Tyndale, “hath but small effect to move the heart if
the ensample of living do disagree....</p>

<p>“And that we worship saints for fear, lest they
should be displeased and angry with us, and plague
us, or hurt us (as who is not afraid of St. Lawrence?
Who dare deny St. Anthony a fleece of wool, for
fear of his terrible fire or lest he send the pox
among our sheep?), is heathen image service, and
clean against the first commandment, which is,
‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one God.’
Now, God in the Hebrew is called <i>El</i>, or <i>Elohim</i>
in the plural number; <i>i.e., strength or might</i>. So
that the commandment is: Hear, O Israel, He that
is thy power and might; thy sword and shield is
but One; that is, there is none of might to help or
hurt thee, save One, which is altogether thine, and at
thy commandment, if thou wilt hear His voice. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
all other might in the world is borrowed of Him;
and <i>He will lend no might against thee, contrary to
His promises</i>. Keep, therefore, His commandments,
and He shall keep thee; and if thou have broken
them, and He have lent of His power against thee,
repent and come again unto thy profession; and He
will return again unto His mercy, <i>and fetch His
power home again, which He lent to vex thee</i>, because
thou forsookest Him and brakest His commandments.
And fear no other creature; for false fear
is the cause of all idolatry.”</p>

<p>The dangers thickened so rapidly around Tyndale
that, in order to elude the restless vigilance of his
powerful enemies, he left Antwerp for a time, and
wandered from city to city in Germany, homeless
and possibly lonely.</p>

<p>Yet he was not idle, for even during this period
of wandering he issued his exposition of the Sermon
on the Mount. The spirit and style of this work
may be estimated from the two following extracts,
the one taken from the Prologue, and the other from
the exposition upon Matthew v. 13:—</p>

<p>“To believe in Christ’s blood for the remission
of sin, and purchasing of all good promises that help
to the life to come, and to love the law, and to
long for the life to come, is the inward baptism of
the soul, the only baptism that availeth in the sight
of Christ; the only key also to bind and loose
sinners; the touchstone to try all doctrines; the
lantern and light that scattereth and expelleth the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
mist and darkness of all hypocrisy, and a preservative
against all error and heresy; the mother of
good works; the earnest of everlasting life, and title
whereby we challenge our inheritance.”</p>

<p>With a terrible inner consciousness of his own
lamentable condition, the exile wrote: “True preaching
is a salt that stirreth up persecution, and an
office that no man is meet for, save he that is seasoned
himself before with poverty in spirit, softness,
meekness, patience, mercifulness, pureness of heart,
and hunger of righteousness, and looking for persecution
also; and hath his hope, comfort, and solace
in the blessing only, and in no worldly theory.”</p>

<p>About this time, also, a great sorrow fell upon
Tyndale, for his trusted friend, John Fryth, who
had ventured into England, was there apprehended
and brought up for trial as a heretic. Tyndale
had some surmise as to his friend’s danger before
the tidings of Fryth’s arrest reached him. He had
written a tender letter of counsel and warning, in
which he advised his friend to be prudent, and especially
to avoid controversy about the Sacrament.</p>

<p>“Wherefore,” said Tyndale, “cleave fast to the
rock of the help of God, and commit the end of all
things to Him; and if God shall call you, that you
may then use the wisdom of the worldly so far as
you perceive the glory of God may come thereof, refuse
it not; and ever among thrust in that the Scripture
may be in the mother-tongue, and learning set up
in the Universities. But and if aught be required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
contrary to the glory of God and His Christ, then
stand fast, and commit yourself to God; and be
not overcome of men’s persuasions” to abjure.
After professing his love for Fryth and his confidence
in him, Tyndale says grandly:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I call God to record against the day we shall
appear before our Lord Jesus, to give a reckoning of
our doings, <i>that I never altered one syllable of God’s
Word against my conscience, nor would this day if all
that is in the earth, whether it be pleasure, honour, or
riches, might be given me</i>.</p>

<p>“My soul is not faint, though my body is weary,”
he says pathetically and touchingly. He concludes
his letter with a sentence which exhibits his own
feelings:—</p>

<p>“He is our God, if we despair in ourselves and
trust in Him; and His is the glory. Amen!”</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">William Tyndale.</span></p>

<p>“I hope our redemption is nigh.”</p>
</div>

<p>Fryth’s bearing before his judges was princely.
He confined his defence to four principal themes,
and these he conclusively argued so that his accusers
were silenced. They were:—“1. That the Pope’s
opinion respecting the Sacrament cannot be considered
as an article of faith necessary to be believed
upon pain of damnation. 2. That, as Christ’s
natural body was in all respects like unto ours, sin
only excepted, there can be no reason why it should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
be in two or many places at once, contrary to the
nature of our body. 3. That we are not to understand
Christ’s words by what we may conceive to
be the meaning of the words, but by comparing one
passage of Scripture with another. 4. That the
manner in which the Sacrament is administered by
the priests is quite different from that in which it
was administered by Christ Himself.”</p>

<p>In the spirit of his friend Tyndale, is also Fryth’s
vigorous and noble reply to Sir Thomas More:—</p>

<p>“Until we see some means found by the which
a reasonable Reformation may be had, and sufficient
instruction for the poor commoners, I assure you
I neither can nor will cease to speak. <i>For the
Word of God boileth in my body like a fervent fire</i>,
and will needs have issue, <i>and breaketh out when
occasion is given</i>. But this hath been offered you, is
offered, and shall be offered: <i>Grant that the Word
of God, I mean the text of Scripture, may go abroad in
our English tongue, as other nations have it in their
tongues, and my brother William Tyndale and I have
done, and will promise you to write no more. If you
will not grant this condition</i>, <span class="allsmcap">THEN WILL WE BE DOING
WHILE WE HAVE BREATH</span>.”</p>

<p>Tyndale wrote a second letter to his noble friend,
and in it he says:—</p>

<p>“Dearly beloved, be of good courage, and comfort
your soul with the hope of this high reward,
and bear the image of Christ in your mortal body,
that it may, at His coming, be made like to His,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
immortal; and follow the example of all your
other dear brethren which chose to suffer in hope
of a better resurrection. Keep your conscience
pure and undefiled, and say against that, nothing.
Stick at necessary things, and remember the blasphemies
of the enemies of Christ, saying, they find
none but will abjure rather than suffer the extremity.
Moreover, the death of them that come again after
they have once denied, though it be accepted with
God and all that believe, yet it is not glorious: for
the hypocrites say he must needs die, denying
helpeth not. But might it have holpen, they would
have denied five hundred times; but seeing it would
not help them, therefore of pure pride and mere
malice together, they speak with their mouths that
their conscience knoweth to be false. <span class="smcap">If you give
yourself, cast yourself, yield yourself, commit
yourself wholly and only to your loving Father—then
shall His power be in you and make you
strong</span>; and that so strong that you shall feel no
pain, which should be to another present death, and
His Spirit shall speak in you, and teach you what
to answer, according to His promise.</p>

<p>“Fear not threatening, therefore, neither be overcome
of sweet words; with which twain methods
the hypocrites shall assail you. Neither let the
persuasions of worldly wisdom bear rule in your
heart, not though they be your friends that
counsel.”</p>

<p>In a postscript Tyndale adds a sentence behind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
which there lies a breaking heart striving to accept
the will of God in heroic faith:—</p>

<p>“Sir, your wife is well content with the will of
God, and would not for her sake have the glory of
God hindered.”</p>

<p>The glory of God was not hindered, for Fryth
went to the stake, and three years after his martyrdom,
Tyndale was also called upon in like manner
to suffer for the truth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tyndale had quietly settled down at
Antwerp, and Foxe has given to us a picture of his
life and doings there. The reader will probably
prefer to read the narrative in Foxe’s own words:—</p>

<p>“And here to end and conclude this history
with a few notes touching his private behaviour in
diet, study, and especially his charitable zeal and
tender relieving of the poor. First, he was a man
very frugal and spare of body, a great student and
earnest labourer, namely [especially] in the setting
forth of the Scriptures of God. He reserved or
hallowed to himself two days in the week, which
he named his days of pastime, and those days were
Monday the first day in the week, and Saturday
the last day in the week. On the Monday he
visited all such poor men and women as were
fled out of England by reason of persecution into
Antwerp; and those, well understanding their good
exercises and qualities, he did very liberally comfort
and relieve; and in like manner provided for
the sick and diseased persons. On the Saturday he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
walked round about the town in Antwerp, seeking
out every corner and hole where he suspected any
poor person to dwell (as God knoweth there are
many); and where he found any to be well occupied,
and yet overburdened with children, or else were
aged or weak, those also he plentifully relieved.
And thus he spent his two days of pastime, as he
called them. And truly his almose [alms] was
very large and great; and so it might well be, for
his exhibition that he had yearly of the English
merchants was very much; and that for the most
part he bestowed upon the poor, as aforesaid. The
rest of the days in the week he gave him wholly
to his book, wherein most diligently he travailed.
When the Sunday came, then went he to some one
merchant’s chamber or other, whither came many
other merchants; and unto them would he read
some one parcel of Scripture, either out of the Old
Testament or out of the New; the which proceeded
so fruitfully, sweetly, and gently from him (much
like to the writing of St. John the Evangelist),
that it was a heavenly comfort and joy to the
audience to hear him read the Scriptures; and in
likewise after dinner he spent an hour in the aforesaid
manner. He was a man without any spot or
blemish of rancour or malice, full of mercy and
compassion, so that no man living was able to
reprove him of any kind of sin or crime; albeit
his righteousness and justification depended not
thereupon before God, but only upon the blood of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
Christ and his faith upon the same, in which faith
constantly he died, as is said at Vilvorde, and now
resteth with the glorious company of Christ’s martyrs
blessedly in the Lord, who be blessed in all
His saints. Amen.”</p>

<p>THE QUEEN’S BIBLE—THE TRAITOR—THE TRAP—THE WEARY
YEAR OF IMPRISONMENT—THE TRIUMPH.</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> years (1533-1535) were spent by Tyndale in
Antwerp, and while engaged in the manner that
Foxe described in the paragraph which we quoted
in the last chapter, he was also employed in revising
his New Testament. The Bishop of Durham says
of this second edition:—</p>

<p>“One of the few copies of this edition which have
been preserved is of touching interest. Among the
men who had suffered for aiding in the circulation
of the earlier editions of the Testament was a
merchant-adventurer of Antwerp, Mr. Harman, who
seems to have applied to Queen Anne Boleyn for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
redress. The Queen listened to the plea which
was urged in his favour, and by her intervention
he was restored to the freedom and privileges of
which he had been deprived. Tyndale could not
fail to hear of her good offices, and he acknowledged
them by a royal gift. He was at the time
engaged in superintending the printing of his revised
New Testament, and of this he caused one
copy to be struck off on vellum and beautifully
illuminated. No preface or dedication or name
mars the simple integrity of this copy. Only on
the gilded edges in faded red letters runs the
simple title, <i>Anna Regina Angliæ</i>. The copy was
bequeathed to the British Museum by the Rev. C.
M. Cracherode in 1799.”</p>

<p>It was almost his last sacrifice for England, for
in the year 1535 Tyndale was arrested. He had,
during this last stay in Antwerp, resided with Thomas
Poyntz, an English merchant who had settled in that
town. This gave Tyndale protection against liability
of arrest, so long as he kept within the house of his
patron and friend. From Poyntz, Foxe obtained
an account of Tyndale’s capture, and we subjoin
it here:—</p>

<p>“William Tyndale, being in the town of Antwerp,
had been lodged about one whole year in the house
of Thomas Poyntz, an Englishman. About which
time there came thither one out of England whose
name was Henry Philips, a comely fellow, like as
he had been a gentleman, having a servant with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
him; but wherefore he came, or for what purpose
he was sent thither, no man could tell.”</p>

<p>This man basely ingratiated himself into Tyndale’s
favour, and although Poyntz distrusted him, even
he did not suspect that Philips was capable of the
baseness of betraying Tyndale to his death.</p>

<p>At length the time arrived when Philips’ arrangements
for the capture of Tyndale were completed,
and when perhaps this Judas had received the
price of blood. It happened that Poyntz “went
forth to a town being eighteen miles from Antwerp,
where he had business to do for the space of a
month or six weeks. And in the time of his
absence Henry Philips came again to Antwerp, to
the house of Poyntz, and coming in spake with his
wife, asking her for Master Tyndale, and whether
he would dine there with him; saying, ‘What good
meat shall we have?’ She answered, ‘Such as the
market will give.’ Then went he forth again (as it
is thought) to provide, and set the officers whom he
brought with him from Brussels in the street and
about the door. Then about noon he came again
and went to Master Tyndale and desired him to
lend him forty shillings; ‘for,’ said he, ‘I lost my
purse this morning, coming over at the passage
between this and Mechlin.’ So Tyndale took him
forty shillings, which was easy to be had of him, if
he had it; for in the wily subtleties of this world
he was simple and inexpert. Then said Philips,
‘Master Tyndale, you shall be my guest here this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
day.’ ‘No,’ said Tyndale; ‘I go forth this day to
dinner, and you shall go with me, and be my
guest, where you shall be welcome.’ So when it
was dinner-time Tyndale went forth with Philips,
and at the going forth of Poyntz’s house was a long
narrow entry, so that two could not go in afront.
Master Tyndale would have put Philips before him,
but Philips would in no wise, but put Master
Tyndale before, for that he pretended to show great
humility. So, Master Tyndale being a man of no
great stature, went before, and Philips, a tall comely
person, followed behind him; who had set officers
on either side of the door upon two seats, who,
being there, might see who came in at the entry;
and coming through the same entry, Philips pointed
with his finger over Master Tyndale’s head down to
him, that the officers who sat at the door might
see that it was he whom they should take, as the
officers that took Master Tyndale afterwards told
Poyntz, and said to Poyntz, when they had laid him
in prison, that they pitied to see his simplicity
when they took him. Then they took him and
brought him to the Emperor’s attorney, or Procuror-General,
where he dined. Then came the Procuror-General
to the house of Poyntz, and sent away all
that was there of Master Tyndale’s, as well his
books as other things; and from thence Tyndale
was had to the castle of Filford (Vilvorde), eighteen
English miles from Antwerp, and there he remained
until he was put to death.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>Demaus assigns the 23rd or the 24th of May
1535 as the probable date of Tyndale’s arrest. For
more than a year the exile lingered in confinement
before he was put to death.</p>

<p>His friend Poyntz did not desert Tyndale in this
calamity, but at imminent risk of his own life he
busied himself in fruitless efforts to save the life of
the man whom he had learned to love.</p>

<p>“Brother,” he says, writing to John Poyntz, a
gentleman at the English Court, “the knowledge
that I have of this man causes me to write as my
conscience binds me; for the King’s Grace should
have of him, at this day, as high a treasure as of
honour: one man living there is not that has been
of greater reputation.”</p>

<p>The efforts of Poyntz were alas useless, and he
only brought himself into peril by his advocacy on
behalf of Tyndale. Poyntz was arrested, and for
four months he also was kept a prisoner. Indeed,
had he not contrived to escape, he would probably
have shared the fate of his friend.</p>

<p>The condemnation of Tyndale was already a
foregone conclusion. The formality of a trial was
indeed observed in his case, but he himself well
knew that, with such enemies as his translation of
the Scriptures had made for him, there was but one
issue to his imprisonment.</p>

<p>One solitary letter, written during the winter
of 1535, and addressed to the governor of the
castle in which he was confined, has indeed been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
preserved. We subjoin Demaus’ translation of
it:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I believe, right worshipful, that you are not
ignorant of what has been determined concerning
me (by the Council of Brabant); therefore I entreat
your Lordship, and that by the Lord Jesus, that if
I am to remain here (in Vilvorde) during the winter,
you will request the Procureur to be kind enough
to send me from my goods which he has in his possession
a warmer cap, for I suffer extremely from
cold in the head, being afflicted with a perpetual
catarrh, which is considerably increased in the cell.
A warmer coat also, for that which I have is very
thin: also a piece of cloth to patch my leggings:
my overcoat has been worn out; my shirts are also
worn out. He has a woollen shirt of mine, if he
will be kind enough to send it. I have also with
him leggings of thicker cloth for putting on above;
he also has warmer caps for wearing at night. I
wish also his permission to have a candle in the
evening, for it is wearisome to sit alone in the dark.
But, above all, I entreat and beseech your clemency
to be urgent with the Procureur that he may kindly
permit me to have my Hebrew Bible, Hebrew Grammar,
and Hebrew Dictionary, that I may spend my
time with that study. And, in return, may you
obtain your dearest wish, provided always it be consistent
with the salvation of your soul. But if any
other resolution has been come to concerning me, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
I must remain during the whole winter, I shall be
patient, abiding the will of God, to the glory of the
Grace of my Lord Jesus Christ, whose Spirit, I pray,
may ever direct your heart. Amen.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">W. Tyndale.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>Says Foxe: “At last, after much reasoning, where
no reason would serve, although he deserved no
death, he was condemned by virtue of the Emperor’s
decree, made in the Assembly at Augsburg, and,
upon the same, brought forth to the place of execution,
was there tied to the stake, and then strangled
first by the hangman, and afterwards with fire consumed
in the morning, at the town of Filford, 25th
of October <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1536; crying thus at the stake with
a fervent zeal and loud voice, ‘Lord! open the King
of England’s eyes!’”</p>

<p>Concerning Tyndale himself Dr. Stoughton justly
remarks: “Tyndale was eminently a great man,
great in mind and heart and enterprise. His intellectual
endowments were of an order to render
him a match in controversy with no less a personage
than the illustrious Sir Thomas More. The qualities
of his heart were as remarkable as those of his head.
He combined a calm and steady heroism with a
childlike simplicity. No man was ever more free
from duplicity, more full of meekness, and at the
same time more elevated in soul by a manly courage.
Ever as in his great Taskmaster’s eye, he pursued
his labours in obscurity and exile, reaping no earthly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
benefit whatever, and looking for no reward but the
smile of his Heavenly Father.”</p>

<p>Nothing need be added to these generous and
just sentences, except that Tyndale’s full merit will
only be known and confessed when the secrets of
all hearts are opened. He professed himself to be
ready to wait for his reward until the great day of
God, and then it will be seen that William Tyndale
has not been far behind the apostles of the Lamb:—</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few

</div>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
